l1mp2t7fgqj3n7|P1 From a Long Time Ago|Hello,. . I was reviewing my grades thus far in the class and one that bothered me was my P1 score. It came to my knowledge that I scored poorly because my functions expected a sorted list when it was to supposed to sort the list within every function. As a result, many functions with correct implementations failed on one small detail. I therefore feel the grade doesn't reflect my mastery of the material.. . I realize P1 was way long ago, and I apologize if this is a bother. In addition, I know EECS 280 has a strict grading policy when it comes to autograder, but I thought this may be an exception.. Thanks,. Daniel |8|0|private|Hi Daniel, unfortunately, cases like this come up a lot and it would not be fair to give credit to some students and not others. Luckily, project 1 is only a small portion of your grade and you were able to learn from it so you can better test your code for future projects.||0

kypbudkxiqu3w9|Project 1 Grade|Good evening,. Sorry to bother but I was just wondering if anyone could provide some clarification about my Project 1 grade; I got an extension for Friday at 8p because I went into quarantine on Tuesday, and the Autograder graded the best submission as of Wednesday instead of my better submission (passed Valgrind) on Thursday. Just wondering if it takes time for it to manually process the extension, or if there was an error. Thank you for your time!|24|0|private|The extension was handled correctly in the autograder, and it doesn't appear that there was any error. The autograder grades all of your submissions fully (including the private tests), and then keeps whichever submission attains the highest score overall. Even though you fixed the error mentioned by valgrind, in doing so I'm guessing you introduced a hard to find bug in your percentile function, resulting in less points on the AG, and thus the AG chose your old submit instead of your new one.||0

kyoqyc3z5254nk|P1 sort in main|Hello, did autograder go through the functions themselves and not through main? In order to be more efficient with my code, I put the sort function in main before any functions were implemented,. After looking at autograder, I noticed that two of my functions (median and percentile) that didn't work were ones that would require the sort function (mode was unscathed because I used sort in the function before I thought to just put sort in main). I was wondering if there was any way my code could be looked at to determine this- my previous class only looked at main and I thought that this autograder would do the same for the tests. If so, is there any way my grade can be revisited? Thank you!|13|0|private|From the P1 spec:.  > The functions in `stats.cpp` must still work when compiled with a different main function.`. . So, they must work for any data, even unsorted data. Thinking with efficiency in mind is a good idea, but unfortunately we can't offer any sort of regrading for the project. P1 is worth a bit less than the other projects, so try not to worry too much and for future projects emphasize unit testing per function.||0
kynynm9ry3e2by|Valgrind Error|Hi! I got a 3/3 on my latest submission but there is a Valgrind error under the main public test and I have totally no idea why it showed up and how to fix it even after reading the previous related posts. Also, I am wondering why the stats private tests did not run? Here are the pictures of the screenshots on the autograder. . . . . As for the Valgrind error, it said there was something wrong with main.cpp line 39 and stats.cpp line 149. Here are my codes.. . . My guess is that on stats.cpp line 149 the [intpart - 1] might be out of the index bound so the error popped up? Can I fix it by adding:. assert(intpart >= 1 && intpart <v.size());. . Last but not least, when I set up Valgrind on my computer, I ran into this problem. Is the Valgrind error related to this problem?. . Thanks in advance. I have struggled with these problems for a long time and still feel pretty lost. It would be great if someone could give me some hints or advice. Much appreciated!!!. |16|0|private|I can't tell you whether that code will fix it or not because that's the same as giving you the answer, but I can say checking for edge cases is exactly what you're supposed to do. Think clearly about when you will go out of bounds in relation to the percentile function and what you should do in each case, for example, what if p = 1?There are a couple other piazza posts related to percentile out of bound edge cases, so I'd recommend checking those as well. . . Private test cases are run after your due date to check the implementation of your code - this is where you will get the majority of your points. . . For the final question, I think it's a little hard to do over piazza because I can't see everything in your system, luckily, we're having [set up clinics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/e/2PACX-1vSzjDOSYXwV9EDEu2ile37BLZqQYpi2UcHl5s6vXeL9kv1VI-_lXEsP7WfyzREUuZreOopIJ4AIs624/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true) all this week if you can make it to one!

kynb8fq77lh296|p1 autograder|For project 1, the autograder did not check the private tests on my latest submission. It ran the  test  through a previous  submission  which was getting a valgrind error.

I don't think I can post my code, but I used a simple for loop that added the value at each index to a double called sum.. .

kyn8dte2v44mo|Question about Mode function in p1|I just wanted to ask a question about the mode function for project 1. I know that private tests cannot be revealed to us, but I just wanted to ask if we would have been graded down for not including the sort() function in mode, or was that hint completely optional for this function? Also is there any possible way we can get feedback for p1 now that the grading is done? It helps to know where you went wrong, or at least to be given a hint about where I went wrong for the test cases I didn't pass?

I understand if that's not possible though since we aren't allowed to know what the private test cases are, in that case I guess I'll just keep testing it to see where it could have gone wrong.. . Also, if I got a 17/18 on the AG, that means my final grade for project one is a 94.4%, correct?|293|1|active|. p1 only counts 5% of total grades. And you only lose 0.3% of the total right now.

It is better than using cout to visually check differences.. . Specifically, I would say that both cout and assert are useful in specific circumstances. Assert is good in that it crashes the program when a test fails. However, it only tells you that your test failed. Cout can give you more detailed information about what is happening in the method.

kykz3ttzxeu3u7|Magic Numbers|How strict will the style grade be on magic numbers? I have some numbers without variable names that I am using for calculations, do I have to create variable names for all of them?|124|1|active|Numbers like -1, 1, 2, 3 are not magic numbers. You do not need to name them.. . Magic numbers like `INT_MAX`, `INT_MIN`, `DBL_MAX`, and `inf` are allowed in p1 because p1 will not be graded for style.. . However, magic numbers usually come with side effects - edge cases. For example, you want to find the min element, so you set your current element to `INT_MIN`. But what if the elements in that array are less than `INT_MIN`? If they are all `INT_MIN - 1`. Choose wisely, and think about is it necessary to use magic numbers?||0

kykym7z548374j|Autograder is saying I have too many definition of main|When I first ran the Autograder, I submitted a stats_tests.cpp with the main function commented out. I did this because when I was running main.exe at the command line, it would say main() was being redefined if I had a main in both main.cpp and stats_tests.cpp. So I removed it and was able to run main.exe. But Autograder is saying that I have an undefined reference to main in stats_tests.  . So I thought the issue might be that I had removed main from stats_tests.cpp, so I added it back in. It just calls one of my test functions and that's it. . Then I resubmitted to Autograder, and it said I was trying to redefine main in main.cpp when it was already defined in stats_tests.cpp. This is the same error I was encountering originally on the command line which led me to remove main from stats_tests.cpp.. . I don't understand why I can't just have main in both scripts.

I know I need to utilize a nested loop to iterate through the vector to compare each value with the rest in the vector, but I'm running into trouble such that after I iterate through the second loop to find the number of times that unique number occurs, I don't know how to effectively ""skip"" the rest of the duplicates in order to start counting the frequency of the next unique value. . . For example, with a vector = 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4. I understand how to compare i = 0 (1) with the rest of the vector, but how do I modify the loop such that I start counting from 2 (i = 3) instead of the next 1 (i = 1, since the loop is set up such that it increments by 1). Since there is no consistent pattern I am unsure as to how to ""skip"" the duplicates and start counting the frequency of the next unique value.. . If this doesn't make sense I can clarify!. "|101|0|active|in the first nested loop, you're comparing v[i] with whatever the number you're counting the frequency for is, right? are you asking how to start counting the next number in the vector? if so, set up your code so that if v[i] doesn't match the number you're counting, you take note of whatever data you need to take note of, and then set the number you're comparing to to the new number. at least in the method i used, i didn't need to use two nested for loops. ||1

Meaning if our code is running and we are happy with it do we have to do the stats_tests.cpp? Thank you!|115|0|active|Your `stats.cpp` and `main.cpp` files will be the most substantial parts of your grade. The autograder runs both public & private tests against them (3 points will come from public tests and a number of points will be from private tests, released only after the deadline).. . While `stats_tests.cpp` is not graded for thoroughness **for P1 only**, it is a good idea to write quality test cases for the sake of running your own code against them to catch bugs. (Think about what types of private test cases we might be checking, and try to replicate them!). . For all future projects, we will be grading the quality of your test cases.||0

If you did, remove that line.. . If you did not set the precision manually. Your program has some problems.

Or is it okay if we just call them data1, data2, etc.?|60|0|active|You can call them whatever you want, but it's usually better to always have variables with meaningful names for your own benefit. That way if you write some code and then look at it a few days later, you'll immediately know what your variables are representing, instead of having to read multiple lines to figure out where and how each variable is used.||0

It looks like you're having trouble using the Makefile to create an executable.

I get a list of errors saying things like ""'summarize': must return a value"", listing 10 different functions within stats.cpp. Why is this?. . According to the tutorial, the assert() functions should be the function stubs. I assumed this meant I did not need to stub the functions myself.

Would that be incorrect?"|122|1|active|Yes, the actual precision of `double` is at least 16 significant digits. Frankly, $$1E-5$$ is a very generous epsilon. If the difference is greater than the epsilon, it means your algorithm might be buggy. Or, your expected output is not precise enough.

And are we assuming that we're always just going to be finding the 0th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 100th percentile? |144|0|active|vp, which is what is returned by percentile,is simply the p-th percentile. The results of your program should match the example shown here in the spec, so it's ok to assume you'll just be finding the 0th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 100th percentile.

Please help me!|17|0|private|I think its always helpful to have a few examples that are small enough to step through your code by hand. Try stepping through your median implementation with two vectors, with an even and odd size, and keep in mind what your expected median should be. I would also write the indices for these vectors too. . For example, here's a vector with an odd number of elements: `[1, 2, 3]` - what should the median be for this? Take a look at the index values too - your implementation says the median should be at index `v.size() - 1 / 2` - does that line up with the expected median?. . Then consider an even number of elements, like `[1, 2, 3, 4]` - what's the median here? How do we calculate a median when there's an even number of elements, and will it be at index `v.size() - 1 / 3`?. . Answering these questions should help you with your implementation!||1

There is no compiling error in Autograder system no matter adding type conversion or not.. . There is an alarm in Xcode but no alarm in Visual Studio Code (I use g++ compiler). So I am afraid whether or not my compiler"|127|0|active|For good practice, you should always **explicitly** cast a type, especially when there is a potential casting overflow. `size_t` is an `uint64_t`, which is longer than `int` which is an `int32_t`. It is possible that this implicit conversion will cause type overflow.. . Because this is not an ISO C++ specified warning, different compilers may have different tolerance of implicit casting. For example, g++ generally reports more warnings than clang++.. . Also, my suggestion is not to use **C-style cast**. It has been deprecated by ISO C++11. The reason that you can still use it is because of the backward compatibility. So, instead of using `(int)`, you can use `static_cast(size_t)`.||1

kydw7qcekubqz|input redirection|What is the purpose of input redirection? I have read about it in the spec but am confused as to what its purpose is for us. I was able to complete the steps in the terminal correctly for input redirection for the main_test.in file. But, when I continued to the next step of going into my IDE (visual studio) and clicked properties to change the command argument main.cpp would no longer compile. It caused the Visual Studio black window to pop up for input and then disappear really quickly. It flickered off like there were too many files with main being compiled at once (I definitely checked and only 1 file with main() was included in the build). Do we have to use the input redirection in our IDE? What is its purpose?|121|0|active|"Before input redirection, you could only interact with your program by typing in the inputs by hand. While you can test your program this way, running through a lot of test cases becomes quite tedious, as they have to be entered manually. By feeding predetermined inputs from input files to the program, input redirection eliminates the need to manually interact with your program, automating the execution of test cases. After you set up input redirection in Visual Studio, your code still compiled and ran, but the output window disappeared immediately because your program read the inputs from your input file, printed the results, and then finished immediately.. . This technique could be outdated, but try pressing ""Ctrl+F5"" to run your program. Visual Studio has a default ""press any key to continue"" behavior for console applications that should be invoked through this key combination (at least, >10 years ago). Alternatively, you can adjust the command-line arguments in Visual Studio for _output redirection_ like ` output.txt`, which would make your program write its output to `output.txt` in its working directory."||0

Your code will probably invoke this constructor (`std::vector::vector(size_type count, T& value)`), which would create a `vector` with `v[i]` elements where each element is a copy of `frequency`. For instance, if you want to record that $$3$$ showed up $$4$$ times, calling `vector(3, 4)` would give you $$[4, 4, 4]$$.

I do not think there is a way to show that temporary variable, I am not sure if `-g3` can show more information. But you can have a try. Following are more details.. . It is an enforced optimization in **C++17**. The standard enforces compiler to optimize `A x = A()`. The reason for this is to optimize the usage of temporary variables. In traditional C++, i.e. C++98, this seemly unharmful assignment operation will cause performance issues. It is what C++ was criticized for before the **Modern C++**, starting from C++11.. . In C++11, this assignment operation can be optimized. Though it is not enforced by C++11, some newer versions of compilers will enforce this particular C++17 mandatory rule even you enable `-std=c++11`, since it is completely optional according to C++11. . . `A x = A()` will call the constructor once and the copy constructor once, which is a meaningless copy, and the meaningless deconstructor once. After the optimization, additional copy operations will be omitted.. . . . Instead of reading the secondary source, here is the ISO C++11 standard, **§12.8.31**. > \- when a temporary class object that has not been bound to a reference (12.2) would be copied/moved to a class object with the same cv-unqualified type, the copy/move operation can be omitted by constructing the temporary object directly into the target of the omitted copy/move||0

While the “actual” function has all of that AND code to do stuff in between the curly braces.You might be familiar with seeing it all included at once with no separation between the declaration and definition. It’s the same thing, but this allows us to separate interface and implementation.Basically, the prototype declares or says “this thing exists”The actual implementation actually does the stuff.For example, we don’t need to know exactly how the sort() function we are provided with works (implementation). We only need to know how to use the function and what values we can pass in (interface). So, rather than knowing the sorting algorithm, we just write sort(v); and it sorts it for us.We generally put the prototypes (declarations) in header (.h) files and the definitions in .cpp files and include the header file in the .cpp file.Again, this is super important to accomplish abstraction. In Professor Juett’s PB&J example. We don’t need to know how to create peanut butter or jelly or bread, we just need to know how to combine them to make a PB&J. Also, whether you realize it or not, we’re already using TONS of abstraction to write the programs we do. We can use a computer and have no clue how computers even came to be or what magic goes on inside them. So abstraction is really important in most academic disciplines, especially computer science.Hope this helps!||0

Edit: like what they actually represent, not the equations for them.|183|2|active|So N is the size of the dataset. Consider the ordered list {15, 20, 35, 40, 50}: N is 5. n is the nth smallest number in the set, given a percentile. So the 40th percentile of the given list is the 2.6th smallest number. So we want to return the 2.6th smallest number in the dataset (obviously the 2nd smallest number is 20). To do this, we split 2.6 up into 2 and 0.6. This is what k and d represent. v sub k is the kth element in the set (so the 2nd element in the ordered set = 20). Then v sub k+1 is the k+1th element of the set (so the 3rd element, or 35). . .

As the student answer suggests, creating a 2d vector from the start is the best idea. You would be able to push 1d vectors into your 2d vector in order to get the result to return. ||0
ky7r94b1o4zzt|finding the median|Hi!. I'm trying to write the portion that will find the median. This is what I currently have.. . . double median(vector<double> v) {. sort(v.begin(), v.end());. double length = v.size() / 2;. if(length != ). assert(false);. . . assert false is still in there only to make it compile. . My plan is to sort the vector in ascending order, then divide the number of terms by two to find the middle value. If the value of the index is an integer, I will add it and the next higher index together and divide by 2 like so:. . example data set: { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. length divided by 2 is 3, so I will take the indix values, after subtracting one because index starts at 0, values of 3 and 4 and divide them to find the average, then return this average. . If the value is not an integer, I will round the index up to the nearest integer and use this as the index to find the value of the median. . example data set: { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}. length / 2 is 3.5. rounded is 4. subtract 1 to get index of median. return median value. . how can I write an if statement to tell it when a value is an integer or not?. .

This also means that if you start earlier, you'll get MORE submits because your submits do NOT roll over! If you don't use any of your 3 submits for a given day, that's ok, but then those submits are gone. Even if you don't think you will be able to get many (or any) points on the autograder, it's in your best interest to start submitting early! Why, you ask?. . It will show you if your code compiles on the Autograder. The Autograder environment is typically at least slightly different from the local environment that you use on your personal computer. Sometimes your project will compile and run just fine in XCode/VS/VSCode, but it won't compile on the Autograder. Typically, this is easy to fix and you can debug it by compiling on CAEN (instructions on how to do this are in the mega tutorial), but it really sucks to learn this the day the project is due and waste one of your submits with a submission that doesn't even compile. This happens a lot. It happens every semester. Don't let it happen to you!You can get points for your test suite. For many project, you get points for writing good test cases that reveal bugs in our ""buggy solutions"". Not only are these (almost free) points, but this can help you figure out how good your test cases are. If you're catching a lot of the bugs on the Autograder and getting a lot of the test case points, you've probably written a great test suite that will help you catch lots of bugs locally before you submit to the Autograder!The Autograder automatically saves a copy of the files you submit. If you go to your submissions and click on one, you'll notice that the files you submit are there at the top as links. If you click on it, it shows your code, exactly as it was when you submitted. Git is the best option we teach you for version control, however, things happen. If your computer breaks before you had a chance to push your code to your Git repository, or you just plain forgot to set up Git, the Autograder will have a backup copy of your code. Every semester, at least one student has their project files corrupted/deleted/etc. If they were using Git (best) or had made previous submits (second best), their code is not all gone!. .

I'm a bit worried about my grade potentially being affected by private test cases.. . Thank you!|150|0|active|It sounds like you’re on the right track with your approach! The best way to do well on the private test cases is by testing your code for potential bugs (I know it’s easier said than done!). One way is to think about “edge” cases: think about “what is the ‘furthest’ I can go before I break the REQUIRES clause?”. For example, if we have a REQUIRES clause that says input has to be an integer greater than 0, we would want to make sure to test by giving the function the value 1 (because this is the “furthest” we can go before breaking the REQUIRES clause if we put the value 0).I would recommend using the REQUIRES clauses as a good starting point, and then thinking about any potential “unique” cases that might be easy to miss out on.Let me know if you have any additional questions!||0
ky6xqrzjwue49i|.at versus [] for vectors - which is better?|For a vector v, since v.at() won't let you reference items outside the bounds of the vector, is using .at() better than [] for accessing elements?. . Are there downsides to .at() (in terms of efficiency or otherwise)?. . Thank you!|141|0|active|I believe the only downside between using v.at() and v[] is that the v.at() is slower due to it checking for a vector being indexed out of bounds. However, I don’t think it matters too much for EECS 280 as run time doesn’t matter till EECS 281 and it isn’t that much slower. However, you could use v.at() first to check if something is being indexed out of bounds and then could change them back to v[] if everything seems fine.||1

A debugger is a actually separate program that ""wraps-around"" the program you want to debug, letting you go line-by-line and view values of variables. gdb and lldb are two common debuggers that are generally used from the command line, and they have functions for things like ""stepping-into"", ""stepping-over"", setting breakpoints, etc. . . The visual debugger that you use from XCode, Visual Studio, or VSCode, is actually just an interface that runs gdb or lldb, but also does nice visual stuff like highlight lines and provide buttons to step over/into (whereas if you were debugging from the command line, you would be typing commands and hitting enter to do everything). Visual debuggers are a little bit easier to use, but we do have tutorials if you want to learn to use gdb/lldb directly!:. * [https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_gdb.html](https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_gdb.html). * [https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_lldb.html](https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_lldb.html)"||0

Can we assume the program will always receive fully simplified decimal values from a tsv so that the former case won't occur?|206|2|active|Yes you may! In other words, you don't have to worry about using an epsilon to make sure something like 1/3.0 == 1 - 2/3.0 is true for the mode, because we're getting the exact decimal values from the tsv file and only trying to find occurrences of that *exact* value. So you wouldn't see 1/3.0 in a tsv, you would be getting the exact decimal `0.33333333333333331`, and your mode would be looking for how often that occurs.. . This isn't exactly the situation for your test cases though - the doubles you get from your stats functions might have weird rounding errors, so asserting them as exactly equal to the expected decimal number might fail.||0

I included p1_library.h, but the when I try to run the main.exe, there is a segmentation fault before I even print ""reading column B from file"".. . . . Terminal:"|36|0|private|You never buffer that last print statement because you do not have << endl at the end (basically meaning it will not show up in the terminal right away), so it is possible and likely that your code is getting past that and segfaulting somewhere else. Using the debugger could be helpful for figuring out when the segfault occurs.. . Edited by David:. . I do not think the lack of flush will cause this issue. Obviously, the line that causes this issue is not in those pictures. Because without Address Sanitizer and UB sanitizer, no one knows what caused this issue.. . By the way, you do not need to flush or endl every time you finish a line. You only need to flush at the very end of your output. So, cout << '\n'; is a more preferable way to print a newline, instead of std::endl.. . Nolan: no it wouldn't cause the issue, but it is why it *appears* that the program crashes before printing that statement. Address Sanitizer and UB sanitizer is a good idea, yes.. ||1

ky64dzwi4za3xr|How does the vector&gt; work?|I’m trying to understand this double vector but is it similar to a two dimensional array or is it something else?|85|0|active|Yes, it is similar in a lot of ways. For example, if you had a 2d array of ints, there would be an int at each index, but instead, there is a vector at each index.Also, because it’s a vector and not an array, it can change size.To help visualize, it would look something like this:{{1, 2, 3},{4, 5, 6},{7, 8, 9}}Where the first vector (holds values 1, 2, and 3) would be at index [0] and the value 2 in that vector would be at index [0][1] (row 0, column 1).If you look up “C++ vector of vectors” or something along those lines there are a lot of good explanations.||0

Okay, your issue is also mentioned on the spec page. Sometimes, the default arguments of your compiler will help it find some missing includes by itself.

In other words, what is actually being incremented with the ++ outside of both sets of brackets? If possible, could you provide an example? |68|0|active|The [ ] operator will actually return a reference to that item in the vector. So, if you increment it with ++ (or modify it with the = operator), it will actually change the value in that vector.For instance v[0]++ will increment the first element in the vector v by 1.If you have a vector of vectors, v[0][1] would increment the second element of the first subvector by 1. So if v = {{0,0},{0,0}}, it would become {{0,1},{0,0}} after this operation.||1
ky579ctfabs2bv|Count Function Error|"What does this error ""implicit conversion loses integer precision"" and then it mentions something with regard to double and int mean?"|115|0|active|Use `static_cast`.

Finally, should we also test out-of-bounds inputs to show that errors occur, or do we not have to consider those?"|157|1|active|For this project you'll only be graded for the presence of test cases for each function in stats.cpp. The actual test cases you write is up to you, and you may realize that there are more edge cases for certain functions than others. For example, the count function probably doesn't have many edge cases, but a function like median might have some tricky edge cases (e.g. odd number of values, even number of values, etc.).

ky28xi2mo286oc|accidentally deleted .exe files|hi, i'm not sure how this happened, but i think all my .exe files from project 1 got deleted? when i try to run the debugger, it tells me stats.exe can't be found, and if i try to run from the terminal i get the message that main.exe isnt a file. im not sure what happened, as the files were working and running just an hour or so ago. i've (mostly) (except for some small bugs) finished the mega starter tutorial, and i also started working on p1 so i'd prefer not to restart entirely? thank you!|102|0|active|Executable files are the files you get after compiling via `make whateverFileName.exe`, so that you can run your code. As long as your `.cpp`, .hpp` files are unchanged, you'll be able to easily make the executable again by following the command.||0

I was wondering what the right direction would be?|16|0|private|Just to make sure, are you trying to test your mean function?

ky10bo9h62xvc|Project 1 Setup/Issue Questions|I realized I have a lot more files than when they're listed in the tutorials, and was wondering if this is an issue? Or how it is meant to look? . . . . And a follow up question, are we meant to be launching Ubuntu and working out of there? I've been navigating to the folder I'd like in File Explorer and typing bash in the address bar as it was a bit unclear. Is there a difference that I need to know for EECS 280?|18|0|private|See Daniel's followup regarding the extra files. . Regarding using Ubuntu, your method of opening a terminal in your desired directory is totally fine (and something I didn't know you could do!) - in the tutorial, it just has you moving around directories using `cd` instead of doing so in your file explorer. I do recommend getting comfortable with only working in the terminal though, since that'll be the only way you can use CAEN down the road (at least without going to an actual CAEN lab). See this guide if you haven't already about CAEN!: https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_caen.html.||1
ky0zv6cmvug1rw|Mega Set Up incomplete|I started getting a head start on the mega setup, but my computer died in the middle of it. If I wait to complete it until later or attempt to restart from the beginning since I'm not sure where I left off will any problems occur? Have any already occurred from being interrupted in the middle of it? |181|0|active|To my knowledge, you could start and stop the tutorial as needed. The only thing that you may need to do is to double-check your current working directory (`$ pwd`) before running commands in the terminal/WSL. Also, if any of the files were not saved you may need to recreate/download them (this would be the starter files and/or the project file depending on how far you were). If you are getting some unusual behavior be sure to leave a followup!||0

Q: I get this error when trying to run VSCode on WSL (error starting the pipe progam):  . . . A: Try changing:. . . ""pipeProgram"": ""c:\windows\sysnative\bash.exe"",. to. . . ""pipeProgram"": ""/mnt/c/Windows/System32/bash.exe"",. in the launch.json. . Q: I’m trying to debug my project with VSCode on Mac, but it’s skipping all my breakpoints. What do I do?. . A: This is a known bug in the Microsoft C/C++ extension. Try installing the `CodeLLDB` extension with the following steps:. . . In VSCode, go to the Extensions tab and search for “CodeLLDB”. . . Set your `launch.json` configuration to the following:. . . . { ""name"": ""(lldb) Launch"",. ""type"": ""lldb"",. ""request"": ""launch"",. ""program"": ""${workspaceFolder}/stats_tests.exe"",. ""args"": [],. ""cwd"": ""${workspaceFolder}"",. }. Q: I’m getting an error in CAEN when I try to compile my code that looks like. . /usr/bin/ld: cannot find /usr/lib64/libasan.so.0.0.0. . collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status. . make: *** [stats_tests.exe] Error 1. . A: Try changing the gcc version by running the following command:. . . module load gcc/7.1.0. You can add the following command to automatically change the gcc version every time you log in:. . . echo ""module load gcc/7.1.0"" >> ~/.bash_profile. Q: Why am I unable to view console output in macOS vsCode?. . A: For Mac users on VSCode, install the “codeLLDB” extension instead of the “C/C++” extension and then set externalConsole to “true”. Now when you run the visual debugger, it will open a new “Terminal” window. . Q: I’m getting the error that “call of overloaded abs(double) is ambiguous” when I’m trying to compare floating points as used in Appendix F of the spec.. . A: Try adding #include <cmath> to the top of the file.. . Q: I haven't worked with vectors before - are there any recommended resources?. . A: You can find a number of vector tutorials online that give a decent introduction. Additionally, here are some links to the ENGR 101 Runestone materials with an introduction to vectors in C++. (These links are to a development server that isn't terribly reliable, but it avoids you having to make a Runestone account. If it doesn't load immediately, try refreshing the page a few times until it does.). . Vectors in C++: http://lobster.eecs.umich.edu:8000/vectors_in_cpp/main.html. Vectors of Vectors, relevant for summarize(): http://lobster.eecs.umich.edu:8000/more_data_structures/main.html. . Q: When I ssh into CAEN, I get put in the root folder (/) instead of my home directory (/home/uniqname/). . A: For some reason, your home directory was not created automatically. You can request for one to be created for you at the IFS storage request page. . . pinittowinit. "|870|1|active|||2
