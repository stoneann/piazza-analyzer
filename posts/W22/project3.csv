l2hymr2psztom|Constructor Question|"I want to make a constructor for my game that default initializes the board to an empty board. I made a print_board() function that prints out the empty board at the beginning of the game. However, the board is different depending how I write my default constructor, even though the results should theoretically be the same.. . But one of them initializes the board to the correct char, '$', while the other one initializes the board to '|' even though I clearly typed '$' as the initializer. Can someone help me figure out the difference between these two constructors?. . . "|240|0|active|I think `TicTac('$');`  is creating another `TicTac` object on the default constructor's stack, which is probably not what you want. You probably want to use a [delegating constructor](https://eecs280staff.github.io/notes/08_ADTs_in_C++.html?#delegating-constructors) to get your intended behavior.||1
l2hp8rgfc7c34a|Does Not Match Return Type|I don't understand why this function is giving me an error. I thought arrays decayed to pointers so shouldn't score be a int* ? It gives me an error when I try to return an array too, so I don't know how I should approach this function.. . |291|1|active|First: it doesn't match return type since that array is a 2d array of ints, so score would decay to an int**, not an int*. Second: this function won't do what you want, since you're returning a pointer to a local variable, which is bad. If you want to return an array from a function like this, you'll probably want to return a vector or a std::array.||1

l11he0mui34zf|Order of addition in copy_all|When running copy_all, if there have been items in the list that every item in the other list is copied into, should the original items be still in the front or at the back? Also, when copying, is the most recently copied item added to the front or the back?|129|0|active|copy_all is a private member function and cannot be called outside of the class. It really is just a helper function for the copy constructor, so it shouldn't matter if you add elements to the front or the back. The list should always be empty when copy_all is called.||0

l0xdmlvoferoq|Compiler Check Confusion|I'm a little confused about this part of the compiler check. If there are only 2 nodes (first and last) and we pop_front and pop_back would that mean we are deleting all the nodes so they would all be null and the list would then be empty?. |127|0|active|If there’s 2 nodes in a list, and we pop_front, we are getting rid of the first node in the list. After the pop_front, there’s now one node in the list, which is simultaneously the first and last element. If we then do pop_back, we are getting rid of the last element in the list, which means that our list will be empty after the function call.||0
l0wv07cs3z06jz|Why Pack.cpp fails?|Hello! I have just seen my project 3 results on Autotrader. I checked my codes and I thought they should be correct. I really do not know why they fail all the tests on Autotrader. I asked this in the lab yesterday, and the IA does not check out any errors either. Could you have a look at it? Thank you!. . |10|0|private|It also seems the default constructor test is failing. Do you notice anything incorrect about your default ctor?||2
l0wsklbm5wv4go|Question to the Project 3 autograder system|"Let me first clarify that I am not asking for a regrade request, and my friend and I only exchanged code as of today (4 days past when project 3 was due).  Within my autograder tests I failed all 4 private pack tests, however my friend passed every test.  Looking at our code the code was almost identical and my question relates to the ""reset"" test, and the two constructor tests.  I'll post photos to the code below however the code between us is almost identical in function.  I'm making this post hoping that this can be a learning moment for me, at this point I don't really care what the autograder returns as my score I just want to understand what I did wrong so I can avoid issues like this in the future.. The photo above shows my code on the left (which failed all 3 tests I previously mentioned before), and my friends code on the right (which passed all mentioned tests before).  To my knowledge these functions are very similar and do the same thing, and I would even say that the reset function is the exact same because well it's only one line.  But obviously these functions are different, but I have no idea how so I was hoping that an instructor could clarify if there's an issue with the semantics or syntax of the code.  The only difference in code between our two files is in our empty check function. . I definitely understand why this is wrong but I was wondering if this was maybe used in the other tests?  I thought this might be helpful in understanding the issue. . . Thank you for taking the time to read this post, I would really appreciate if this wasn't just disregarded and was answered, I want to again clarify I'm not upset at my grade or trying to squeak some extra points out, this seems to happen to me every project and I would really like to try and avoid this for project 4 and 5, so I came to piazza to hopefully improve my knowledge of C++."|11|0|private|Another instructor can add on if they see fit, but the difference I see is that your empty function returns true if your pack of cards is completely full.||1
l0u9b17pxns709|Cards not added to hand, because hand is private?|In euchre.cpp, I am trying to deal each player their cards, but it is not working. After I try to deal them cards, each player doesn't even have the variable hand. So the upcard becomes the first in the entire pack. I will include code snippets below. Is there some way I could work around this? I am using multiple functions for game instead of a class ADT, could that be the reason? My project is due tomorrow due an extension and I really don't know how to fix it.  I believe everything else works.  Players do not have the variable hand to sstore the cards. This is the output, because the hands have nothing|13|0|private|It's okay if the player's hand is private, but you do need to use a Game ADT/class and make your players & functions members of the class.

l0tdb6wvvvf2db|Shuffle() Iteration Error|Despite using a for loop that is meant to repeat the shuffle seven times, the results of the shuffle function act as if it is only shuffling once. I am not sure what is wrong or how to go about fixing this.|13|0|private|The set up of your for loop seems good. I would suggest reworking the three lines on the inside of the for loop. remember, you are going to be rewriting every single card (indexes 0-23) in the pack because the shuffle changes all of their indexes. In your implementation it looks like it only changes the cards in the pack in range j (0 - 11) and halfdeck - j (11 - 0). ||0

I just ran the diff checker on my terminal between my output and the correct output, and it showed that mine had an extra new line. However, when I upload my exact same files onto the autograder, it says it passes. I looked at my output and it seems like the autograder got rid of a new line at that position.. . So if you are having this issue, it should be fine once you upload because I think the autograder automatically subtracts a new line at that part for some reason. .

Also below is my current autograder error.. . |12|0|private|A quick fix is to wrap operands of type `size_t` in `int()`, like `int(followSuit.size())`.

I'm not sure how to fix this, I would appreciate some help!|84|0|active|A segmentation fault basically means that you're accessing memory outside the scope of your program, so memory you shouldn't be accessing. The best way to track this down is to use a debugger. If you're using VSCode, you can simply set it up using the instructions for your system in the mega tutorial. Then, simply run the debugger and, when your program crashes, it will provide you with the call stack and the value of the variables in your code. With these two, it will be pretty easy to figure out why your code is causing a segmentation fault. The great thing about VSCode's debugger is that when you have errors like this, you don't even have to set up breakpoints to check where your code might have failed. You can simply run it without breakpoints and it will stop whenever the error is detected.||0

Secondly, my constructor, get_name(), and add_card() are exactly the same in my SimplePlayer and HumanPlayer classes. The constructor has no lines,  get_name only has a return statement, while add_card() has 3 statements. I'm getting a duplication error. How can I tackle this?|122|0|active|For the first question, you can't add any functions in the Simple Player class because you can only have the ones that are in Player.h. However you can add a helper function outside the class by declaring a static function in the same file. Just make sure you're passing around your variables properly (pass by reference when you need to modify, etc) because you won't have access to member variables when you're in a helper function, so you'll need to pass them in. . .

In this case, you would play the highest card that follows suit and that excludes led_suit. . 3rd Case: Trump suit and the led_suit are different but their color is the same. For example: if trump is spades, and the led_suit is clubs. In this case, if the player does have a left_bower. It would seem that the left_bower follows suit but that is incorrect. Imagine the left_bower has to have the same suit as trump so that would mean that the player would not be able to play left_bower. EDIT: Also, the left bower IS treated as if it is the trump suit when trump is active, like it’s not gonna be treated like it’s the suit that’s actually ON the card.

We consider the Left Bower to have the trump suit, so Jack of Diamonds belongs to Hearts, not Diamonds, in this hand. Therefore, having it does not enable Gabriel to follow suit when King of Diamonds was led by Edsger.||0

Will I lose points when the private tests are run? Because, I've still been awarded points for the Euchre public tests.|108|1|active|"The students' answer correctly identified (guessed by chance?) the problem you had. In general, if you see a Valgrind error on the autograder, open the dropdown and read the information it's giving you. Because Valgrind checks for memory usage, it tells you about instances where your program mismanaged memory, like when you allocated but didn't free a chunk of memory (Valgrind calls this ""definitely lost""), by showing you where your program allocated that memory. For each message, the lines after it describe the functions that were running when the action occurred. In your instance, lines 1-4 describe that ""`main()` called `Player_factory`, which called `operator new`... this is where your program allocated memory that wasn't freed"".. . To resolve Valgrind errors, first parse the error message to find out what memory got involved and how it got mismanaged. Then, revisit your intended logic to ensure that it frees all allocated memory. Finally, check code handling this memory to check that you expressed that logic correctly."||0

Most of the time, this is caused by putting cout statements in wrong places (for example, using cout in simple player functions when those statements should be in euchre.cpp). . 2. Why are the players playing their highest card when not following suit? . It is because they are following suit. The suit of the left bower is of the trump suit. For example, if trump is clubs and Jack of Spades is leading, that means the lead suit is clubs. This means if Mary has Ace of Clubs and King of Spades, she will choose to play Ace of Clubs to follow suit.. . 3. Why are the players playing their lowest card when they can follow suit?. Similar to the answer to Q2. If the left bower is in the hand of a player, the suit of that card is that of the trump suit, and this will affect whether they can/cannot follow lead. For example, if Uri has Jack of Hearts in his hand while Diamonds is trump, then that means he has a diamond card, not a heart card. . . 4. What am I supposed to cout in Player.cpp and euchre.cpp?. This is written in the spec, ""Human Player Protocol"" and ""Printing Output"". Essentially, cout statements (such as saying who won) that are used for both Human and Simple players should be in euchre.cpp, while cout statements specific to Human (such as listing out the cards in a player's hand) should be in Player.cpp in the Human class.. . 5. Why is my program giving me a runtime error saying I am trying to create an abstract class?. If you are using the dereference operator on Player_factory, the program tries to create a Player object, which is an abstract class. Since all of the functions in the Player class are pure virtual functions, this gives an error since the program tries and is unable to create a Player object. If you are using a vector of Player objects, use a vector of Player pointers instead."|305|3|active|||0
l0oka9euiz61ci|Error: passing &#39;const card&#39; as &#39;this&#39; argument discards quantifiers|". . When trying to compile euchre in ubuntu, this is the result I get. This error repeats a couple times in different spots, but all with this same message. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe this has to do with the #include <algorithm> and std::sort(hand.begin(), hand.end()); I have just before I ever need to print the player's hand. How should I go about fixing this?. . EDIT: It also mentions how there is ""no matching function for call to ‘swap(const Card&, const Card&)’"" which I assume is used in sort. Were we supposed to implement that?"|98|0|active|It's hard to tell exactly where the issue is occurring just from this screenshot, but your intuition is correct. swap is used within sort, a function that you are free to use from the standard library. If the cards in the players hands are const, that may be an issue, as the sort function won't be able to modify any of the cards in hand to swap them around.. . So, check your const qualifiers on your card-related variables and see if there's anywhere that you shouldn't be including const.||1

l0ojyha7sjo6o4|Lead and Play Card|Hello,. . I've been getting a false positive on one of my tests and I was wondering if I was understanding these two functions (which I'm testing) correctly. . . So, let's say the trump suit is spades and a Simple player has this hand:. 10 of Spades. Ace of Spades. King of Spades. Queen of Spades. Jack of Clubs. . Would the Simple player lead with the Jack of Clubs because it's the highest trump card and they only have trump cards in their hand? . . Additionally, let's say the Jack of Clubs is a led card and the Simple player has the same hand without the Jack of Clubs. Would the player then play the 10 of Spades because they don't have any cards with a Club suit and it's the lowest card in their hand? |96|0|active|If Jack of Clubs is lead, that means Spades is leading and the player should play the highest lead card, which in your example should be ace of spades||0

We really cannot figure out how to resolve this. Any help would be greatly appreciated!"|6|0|private|Here's a few pieces of advice!. 1. Wherever you call `get_suit()`, make sure you're always passing in the trump suit - that should take care of treating the left bower as the trump suit. 2. Prefer to use `Card_less()` as much as possible - that should have all the logic for handling the bowers, led suit, and trump suit, so using that will keep your code simple so you don't have to check for specific cases everywhere in your Player functions. 3. The spec's instructions for `play_card()` break down into two cases - if the player can follow suit, or if they can't. I would design your function into two separate cases, so you don't have to handle both cases at the same time.. 4. You don't need to do everything in a single for loop across the player's hand! You can loop through it multiple times, so that might help you understand which case you're in for #3. 5. It can help to create temporary vectors of cards, so you only have to think about those cards, rather than all possible cards in the player's hand. . Hopefully this helps!||0

Visit these spots in your source files. First, verify that the logic you're trying to express ensures that every player points to a valid object, not null. Next, trace through your assignments to the Player pointers to ensure that your logic is expressed correctly. You can use a debugger and set breakpoints around line 34 in euchre.cpp to inspect the values of related variables and trace through your logic using those. With that debugger, you can step through all the lines prior to the error location, tracing the logic manually and cross-checking your results with what the debugger shows.

Thank you for your help|9|0|private|First, we know the file for the pack is: argv[1];. Second, we want to use an ifstream so we can read from the pack, so something like: ifstream fin(argv[1]);. Third, we have a constructor in the Pack class that takes in a stream (the one we declared in the line above) and creates a pack, so something like you're already doing but you just pass in fin: Pack pack(fin);. . Also, don't forget to make sure the file is open.||1

l0kgnolow7p251|SimplePlayer play_card|The spec indicates to play the 'lowest card' if the SimplePlayer does not have the same suit as the led suit. It says that it only considers led suit too.. . In euchre_test00.out.correct, the player Dabbala has the following cards:. . { Ace of Spades , King of Clubs , Queen of Clubs , Ten of Hearts , Nine of Hearts }. . Trick 1 (led = Spades): Dabbala plays Ace of Spades. Trick 2 (led = Clubs): Dabbala leads King of Clubs. Trick 3 (led = Diamonds): Dabbala plays Queen of Clubs. . If Dabbala had no Diamonds in Trick 3, then they should play their lowest card (only considering lead suit), which should be the Nine of Hearts. Should Dabbala's cards be sorted with consideration of which suit is trump, so the Nine of Hearts would be more valuable than Queen of Clubs because Hearts is trump? If so, would we have to make our own sort function using Card_less since the vector sort() does not consider trump?|142|0|active|Correct, since Hearts is the trump suit, the Nine of Hearts and the Ten of Hearts are more valuable than the Queen of Diamonds in this hand. Also correct, you want to be able to sort a player's hand while considering the trump suit and the led card so that the simple player can correctly choose the card to play.||0

(but make sure you change it back before submitting so it only does it 7 times!)

Should we just have 4 different member variables, one for each type? but then we can't call the type until we know what it is :/|11|0|private|"Being totally lame here, it sounds like you could use the power of polymorphism!

So, you definitely don't want to hardcode any types like Simple or Human, because we want any players in euchre to be any type - but at the same time, we only want to write a single implementation for euchre.

The key idea behind writing scalable code is that different portions of our codebase shouldn't depend on one another.

For example, if you had something in your Euchre class like:. . if(bool_check_human(player)) {.   // do human thing. } else {.  // do player thing. }. and then in the future your started adding a bunch of more sophisticated Player types (maybe ""Advanced""), then you would need to go back and change the code above.

l0if9lh74pb3lj|using syntax outside of scope of 183 and 280|Is it ok to use something that was never really taught in 180 or 280 on projects? I am specifically referring to ternary operators.|68|0|active|Generally, when we refer to C++11, we are actually referring to C++11 and C++14, because C++14 is a fix of C++11. However, in 280, we literally mean C++11, the specific version of C++. Therefore, sometimes you must use ternary operator in C++11.. . The most special case that you must use ternary operator in C++11 but no need in C++14, is in the `constexpr` function. C++11 does not fully support branches in `constexpr` functions. But it supports ternary operator, which is essentially a if-statement. It is a flaw in C++11, but it got fixed in C++14. That is the only case you must use ternary operator in C++11.. . Also, sometimes ternary operator can refine your code, like single statement lambdas. In C++11, the return type deduction only supports single statement, so ternary operator might be helpful in this case. But in C++14, it supports multiple statements return type deduction.. . Besides, in some cases, ternary operators can decrease the readability of your code. However, sometimes it can improve the quality of your code, i.e. optimize out a temporary variable, remove redundant branches, etc. It is like `auto` keyword and `{}` initialization, the greater power comes with greater responsibility.||0

l0fx9guht4876s|Simple player test|I'm still getting 16/17 in the simple player test and I was wondering how can I find that test function? What are some tips to find that because I have like 30 tests.|202|0|active|I just realized I read the question wrong (oops) so I will attempt at answering again. For player_tests I think the most important thing is the add_and_discard function. There are many important things to test with this function: for example, what happens if all the cards in your hand is higher than the upcard? What if your lowest card is at your first or last index?. . The second important function is lead card. Try making a test with just lead card and another test with both lead card and play card. Another important thing you might want to test is if these functions are succesfully removing a card for the hand each time you play. When we first implemented these functions, we realized we forgot to remove the card after we play it, so each player essentially had an infinite number of cards. Try playing/leading the cards until a player's hand is completely empty. If it is not successfully removing, or if there are out of bounds errors on vectors, creating such scenarios will be able to detect them.Additionally, make sure you are reading the RMEs, thinking about the possible things that you might be missing in your test. For example, our make trump forgot that we don't change the order up suit if they pass. And we forgot to add trump to our get suit in play card.||0

These assert statements aren't working for all of the ones that are comparing the strings(3rd to end) and an alternative and I did it as I did in the 4th one for all of them yet it still didn't work. I was wondering if you could give me some advice on making these assert statements work?|6|0|private|Your approach is very interesting - it looks like you're checking 7 different conditions of the arguments, and you decrement a count when any of them are met. You need all 7 conditions to be true, so by then end, count should be 0 - if it isn't, then you have an error and need to print the statement. Given that, you should make sure every one of your if conditions is checking that the argument is *correct* - right now, in some of your if statements, you're checking if its incorrect, and in others you're checking if its correct. They should all be consistent/checking the same thing. . Another note is that you should be careful when indexing into argv - you're accessing indices, but there's no guarantee that those indices exist. You need to make sure argc is at least 12 before you access argv with any index 0 through 11, you won't be able to handle all of these cases together in one pass, if that makes sense. You'll need some method of short-circuiting your logic, or at least making sure some code isn't run if other conditions aren't met.||1

I'd look through the stack trace (those are the lines printed below the error message) to see which files/functions your program went through when valgrind detected the memory error. The stack trace is printed starting from the most immediate stack frame at the top, then proceeding out - this means the top most line (that you can recognize as one of your project files, often there'll be other library files thrown in there that you can ignore) is the most recent line it was at, and the bottom most line is where your program started (notice this is your main function, which makes sense because that's where C++ programs always start executing).. .

You would probably need at least one human player, so you have some control over the cards played. You would have the most control with 4 human players, because you can decide what cards everyone plays (so long as you're still following the rules of euchre). For example, there's specific logic for scoring based on the number of won tricks: https://eecs280staff.github.io/p3-euchre/#scoring - try figuring out what cards need to be played to lead to the different scoring scenarios.. . Here are some more concrete steps with 4 human players to test a march!:. 1. Compile your euchre program and run it with the arguments for 4 human players. 2. Based on everyone's hands, decide which suit should be trump (if you don't want the led suit, you can have all 4 players pass, then choose any of the other 3 suits).. 3. Coordinate the cards everyone plays to make sure only one team wins all 5 tricks. 4. Check the points afterwards to make sure that team received 2 points instead of just 1. . Note that the cards in every players' hands are deterministic, even with shuffling. So you can keep running your euchre program to understand what cards each player has in a particular hand, which should make planning easier.||0

King of Spades, Jack of Clubs, Nine of Clubs, Ten of Clubs, Queen of Spades. This is the led cards in order of each trick (trump is Hearts):. Jack of Spades, King of Clubs, Ten of Diamonds, Jack of Hearts, Queen of Hearts. . My question is, for play_card when it asks to play a card that follow suit of led card, is the right bower of the led card considered following suit?|118|0|active|As the student answer mentioned, the left bower should always be treated as a card of the trump suit. Remember that there are two `Card::get_suit()` functions, and one of them takes in the trump suit and handles this situation with the left bower. I'd recommend trying to use this version of the function whenever possible, so you don't have to have any other logic that's also checking for the left bower, and its all just handled in get_suit.. . That being said, the Jack of Clubs is not the left bower in this situation. Since trump is hearts, the left bower is the Jack of *Diamonds*, not the Jack of Clubs. I'd check you're handling of the trump suit and left bower, making sure that its only the Jack of the off-suit of trump that is considered the left bower.. . I wonder if the led suit for this trick has anything to do with it too - its Spades in this case (and the Jack of Clubs is the jack of the off-suit for Spades), so I'd make sure you're not mixing up the trump suit and the led suit either.||0

Since you got a runtime error (an `std::bad_alloc`) when you ran your euchre program, that's probably why your output is cut short. If you have a visual debugger set up, I'd recommend stepping through until you ask people to `make_trump()`, since the output cuts out just before you ask Kunle to make trump in the output. A bad alloc happens when you're trying to allocate memory but for some reason it wasn't possible - usually because you've run out of memory. I would keep that in the back of your mind while you're debugging, just to help identify the line where things are going wrong!||1
l0aavpfm49e4pv|Pass by value vs Pass by Reference|So if I understand correctly, if we just want the value of an object, for example, to use in an if statement in a function, we should pass by value. However, if we are looking to actually change a variable in a function, then we should pass by reference.|55|0|active|Mostly yeah - usually you pass by value unless there's a specific reason to pass by reference. One reason is, like you mentioned, to modify the value of a variable outside the function call, but there's also the case where you pass by const reference. You'd do this to avoid creating a copy, for memory efficiency reasons. For example, if you needed to pass a really large vector into a function, you don't want it creating a copy so you pass by const reference. That way the function still gets the value, but you can be sure it won't get modified while its inside the function call. ||0

Then, your logic could start from that index + 1, and continue for 3 more players. The only problem is looping back around after 3.

You're also dealing cards one at a time - we could potentially use a loop to iterate 2 or 3 times to clean this up a little. What if we had some sort of vector that looked like `[3,2,3,2]`?

Its definitely helpful to get another set of eyes on the issues you're having.. . It looks like your code compiles just fine, but you have a runtime error - specifically a segmentation fault when you run the tests. Segfaults are usually the result of indexing out of bounds somewhere, or accessing some memory that you're not supposed to/that hasn't been specifically allocated.. . It looks like you've narrowed it down to the default_ctor test, so now your job is to just continue narrowing it down until you can find the offending line that's causing the segfault, then understand why its causing errors. A really helpful tool for this is your visual debugger, so I'd try to set some breakpoints and step through your code line by line to see which function is causing the error. If you step over a line with a function call and your debugger crashes, that means you want to re-run your debugger and step *into* that function, then repeat (step over line-by-line again until you hit a function that fails or you get to the bottom most line that's causing the segfault). That's an efficient method for narrowing down errors like this. . Some other tips: Make sure to check all of your loop bounds and anywhere you're indexing into an array, since those are common causes of segfaults - for example, in your loop constructor, are you sure that you're only accessing valid indices in `RANK_NAMES_BY_WEIGHT` and `SUIT_NAMES_BY_WEIGHT`?  Its really common to have off by one errors inside of Pack, because you need to make sure you're identifying the exact bounds of different indices.. . Hope this helps!||0

OR, are we supposed to be re-shuffling after each hand?. (2): If we are supposed to be initializing a new pack on each hand and shuffling the same way, wouldn't this bring up an issue with which players get which cards? We figured that if we do conduct the game in this way, we would have predictable hands, and each hand in the game would be the same combination of cards, simply shifted down a player.. . Thank you in advance!|190|2|active|Reshuffling at the start of each hand should be enough, you don't need to reconstruct the pack every hand (as outlined in the steps per hand here: https://eecs280staff.github.io/p3-euchre/#setup-table). . You are right though that the shuffling is predictable - even though we do the in-shuffle 7 times, there is no element of randomness meaning its kind of predetermined who will get what cards. Its not quite as bad as you describe, since we aren't reinitializing the pack every time so its not exactly the same hand being played every turn - instead, its the same pack that's been in-shuffled 7 times the first hand, then 7 more times the second hand, and so on. Its still predictable though. That makes it easier for grading/verifying output, but you'd probably write a more random shuffle function for Pack if you wanted this euchre game to be more interesting! ||0

The code runs fine with my debugger, any suggestions? . . . |213|2|active|"Whenever you're looking at valgrind errors, you want to try and find anything readable or relevant (since a lot of it will just be memory architecture mumbo jumbo and complicated errors). Valgrind prints out a sequence of errors in chunks, so in this case, the important pieces are, from bottom to top:. * ""Segmentation Fault"" at the end - this means your program tried accessing memory it wasn't supposed to and crashed. * Access not within mapped region at address 0x0 - this is super helpful, because address 0x0 is the nullptr, meaning somewhere you're dereferencing this which is likely causing the segfault that crashed your program. * Invalid write of size 2 - similar to the previous invalid access, you're trying to write to memory that isn't valid/appropriately allocated . * Use of uninitialized value of size 8 - the size isn't super important, but this means you're using an uninitialized variable that will have undefined behavior. * Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialized values - basically the same thing as the previous error, there's an uninitialized variable you're using in like an if branch or loop. . Each chunk of text after each error is a stack trace - this is the path your code took to get to the error that valgrind detected, from bottom to top (so starting from main at the bottom, then going into the first function called from main on the next line). This means the top most line is the very last function your program was running when valgrind detected the error - this is a good place to start looking (or at least the topmost file that is something you recognize as one of your files), but note that the error could be in any function your code went through before it got to that point.. . In your case, all your errors end up in Pack.cpp (you can find that filename in the stack traces for all of the errors) in the Pack constructor with istream, so it looks like you might be using uninitialized values when constructing Pack. I'd run the Pack public tests through valgrind just to confirm though. Hope that helps! "||0

kzssgk08mfu6ay|Project 3 question|For the get_suit function that considers the trump suit, why would the trump suit matter if we are just returning the suit of the Card?|96|0|active|It matters because of the left bower.

For example:Say the trump suit is hearts.The left bower is the Jack of Diamonds (the right bower is the Jack of Hearts).If you didn’t consider the trump suit, the get_suit() on the left bower (Jack of Diamonds) would return Diamonds, but it’s actually considered to be trump suit (Hearts)All other jacks and cards (so everything except for the left bower) return their normal suits.As a side note: Because of this, the bowers are potential “troublemakers” if you will.

This is the pure virtual function from player.h we are supposed to override. virtual const std::string &get_name() const=0;. virtual...const=0           means this is a pure virtual function. std::string &                    is the return type reference to a string. get_name()                     is the name of the function and empty parameter list. Why are our get_name functions returning a reference? Wont returning a reference to a private class member cause errors?. If I am misunderstanding this line of code, what does the '&' mean?|84|0|active|You are understanding the line of code correctly. The reason that we return a reference is that it can be very expensive (in terms of runtime) to pass an arbitrary length string by value since it involves copying that whole string. By passing by reference, we avoid making a copy of the string. . . You bring up an interesting point that this reference gives us access to the private member variable. In this case (and usually in general), we are marking this reference const so that no one who calls this method can modify our private member variable unknowingly. However, it is possible to pass a reference to a private member variable without the const keyword, allowing other functions to modify a class's private member variables. The compiler doesn't complain about this since the outside functions are not directly accessing the variable, but rather doing it indirectly through references. ||1

kzrv335u8ub4gx|Human clarification about make_trump sort &#43; is_dealer|"(1) In the spec explaining the Human player functions, making trump's function says ""first print the Player’s hand. For consistency with the autograder test cases, print the Cards in ascending order, as defined by the < operator in ""Card.h"". However, the make_trump function in the Player.h file is a const function, so sorting the hand would cause us to break this const stipulation. Should we get rid of the const part of the function when we are implementing the Human::make_trump? Or are we supposed to assume that the hand will be ordered when we call Human::make_trump (as in, this would be implemented later somewhere in the driver).. . (2) Also, the make_trump function includes a is_dealer parameter in the Player.h file. Of course I'm pretty sure that parameter is there for the Simple player implementation, I was wondering if it is necessary to include in my human implementation of the function.. . (3) Lastly, in the function add_and_discard, the spec explains that human players who are dealers will pick up the upcard. However, the add_and_discard function does not have a is_dealer parameter. Should I assume that the is_dealer part comes in when we implement the driver and that I only have to worry about prompting the discard of a card at this point?. . Thank you!"|255|0|active|You cannot assume the card will be in order. And you cannot change the interface. You can try to use a helper function for printing player's cards.The is_dealer parameter must be included for human player. Otherwise, you will not be able to override functions. And the subtype polymorphism will behave unexpectedly. For human player, you should be promoting the discard of a card when the add_and_discard function is called. And yes, the is_dealer part will be in the driver program. . ||0

Is there other ways to assign values or I should write a operator= function in Card.cpp? Or perhaps I shouldn't assign values for the array in constructors?|77|0|active|You should be able to set cards[index] = a Card object.

However, the add_and_discard human player function only has one parameter of upcard, so how does it know if the player is the dealer or if it is round 1?"|126|0|active|You do not need to know. When you are working in add_and_discard you assume they are the dealer and it is round one as that is the only case you could call add_and_discard.

If you count 0 then you don't have any trump cards. If you count say 4 trump cards and the player only has 4 cards in their hand then they probably only have trump cards.

For the first example you provided, a clubs was led. According to the simple player strategy, the simple player first attempts to play the highest card that follows suit.

To test this function, I am just considering that the player only has one card in their hand, picks up the upcard to have two cards, discards the lower one, and then playing their one card, which should be the higher of the two cards based on the trump (and led) suit. Is this an ok way to test this function?. . In reality, the player (dealer) would have five cards because trump is only made once per hand, correct? But, it's easier to consider one or two cards and check edge cases with those and the concept is the same, right? There technically wouldn't be a led card yet, either (which is required to call play_card()), but this should still work for the test case.. . Or, should this function just be tested within other function tests, such as lead_card() and not tested individually?. . 2. To make sure I'm thinking about it correctly, basically the structure of the game is: making trump (1-2 rounds), trick taking until every player has played all five cards (which completes one hand), one team scores x points, back to making trump and repeat until y points is attained by a team.EDIT: Never mind, implemented my tests and was able to catch all the bugs on the AG. |308|2|active|Marking resolved||1

kzm5qle3nuw24y|How to use sort function on cards?||127|0|active|First, think about how we would call `std::sort` on cards. How often would we need to call it? What kind of data structure could you use to easily insert elements and sort them (Hint: Think about Project 1 and what we used to store data). . Secondly, once we know how to call the sort function on some data structure holding cards, how can we guarantee that `std::sort` will work and not break/throw compiler errors? This is fairly direct, as for `std::sort`, we only need to make an operator overload for `<` to ensure we can sort in ascending order for a custom type that we made (in this case, Card). Since this is an operator we have you guys implement in `Card.cpp`, once this is implemented and working, calling `sort()` on some data structure holding Cards will work.. .

For Card_less you could also try to think of every combination of two cards; we have three options the cards could be (Trump, Led, or No Trump) and 3 x 3 means 9 different pairings we could make with the two cards, so I try to cover all 9 pairings (and also, I called other functions in mine so some of the pairings were redundant/tested in my other function so I didn't do all 9 in Card_less).. . Then I just added the left/right bower stuff before all my other tests since those two cards take precedence over everything else.. . Writing the tests was similar to writing Card_less, since in both functions I was considering edge cases, so maybe see if there was anything you did for writing Card_less that might help making writing test cases more organized.

kzii1lpklb2gy|Pack.cpp Default Constructor|Hello, I'm a little lost about how to initialize Pack. How would I initialize an array of n (in this case 24) Card elements using an initializer list?

Also, do I have to 'name' each card ( like do I have to name each card element c1,c2,c3 etc or can I just call the card initializer as Card(rank, suit). |252|2|active|In an initializer list, for each variable $$v$$ you want to initialize, you specify arguments to pass to a constructor of $$v$$. For `Pack`, this means your initializer list would have to initialize the deck using a `std::array` constructor. This doesn't give you much room to express the default card ordering succinctly (the best you can do is list out the 24 cards manually), so I would encourage you to consider setting up the card ordering in the body of the constructor instead.. . When you're assigning newly constructed Cards directly to elements in an array, there is no need for distinct variable names. Like how you can name variables whatever you want without changing the program's behavior, they are purely cosmetic here.||0

As for your Pack initialization, first note that a `std::array` of Cards is much like a C-style array of Cards---it _contains_ all the 24 Cards themselves, not pointers to Cards. A Card cannot take on the value of nullptr because it's not a pointer, so you can't really initialize an array of Cards to nullptrs. In your case, I would step through your default Pack constructor in a debugger and check if all the variables take on values you expect.

For example, if a SimplePlayer has $$\{9\spadesuit, 9\clubsuit, 10\diamondsuit\}$$ and intends to play in a round where the led suit is $$\heartsuit$$, this suit ordering dictates that to play the lowest card, they should play the $$9\spadesuit$$ instead of the $$9\clubsuit$$.||0

If the operator functions are comparing the value of the cards, how can rhs and lhs can be equal? Since there are no two of the same cards in a deck, it's impossible for the value of the cards to be the same, right?|169|3|active|1. That is correct, the operator functions are comparing the values of the cards. For example less-than first checks the ranks of cards a and b, and if they are both equal, then checks the suit.. . 2. You are correct, there are no two of the same card in a deck so it is unlikely you would use the == operator in the implementation of a card game. That being said, I would think of the Card class as a module that you are using to implement Euchre but could be used for many other purposes. In other words, just because you might not have a need for the == operator to implement Euchre, doesn't preclude there from being someone else who might want to use your Card Code that would have a need for it (For instance, some games call for multiple decks).||2

kzewct5jkjr206|Card_less|Will the private tests for this have both Card a and Card b be the same card? or should we assume they are different cards?|170|0|active|"TL;DR: Not sure what the private tests do or don't test, but its safe and reasonable to *not* make that assumption based on the function RME.. . If I understand the motivation for your question, I think its something like: Every card in a game of euchre is unique by its combination of rank and suit, so you wouldn't really run into a situation where you would be calling Card_less on the same card, at least in the context of this game. So, are the private tests taking that into account when testing your Card_less?. . The instructors are the only ones who really know what's being tested in the private tests, so we can't answer too many questions about them or what reasonable assumptions you can make about them. Whether or not they do test this case with Card_less, we just need the RME to understand how to implement it, and the RME for this function has no REQUIRE clause that Card a and b don't have the same rank and suit. So, given that we could pass in the same card to both parameters of Card_less, you should consider what behavior your implementation should have to meet the EFFECTS clause, that it will return true if a is less than b and false otherwise. . . The ""less than"" relation we're defining for cards is the same as the mathematical relation "||0

The virtual specifier means that this function will not be bound to the class by the compiler during the compile time (statically). Instead, The program will dynamically decide which function to call during run time. In euchre.cpp, you will create 4 players, but you do not know their type when you code your program. So, you decide to use Player *player = Player_factor() to catch all players regardless of their type. This is allowed in C++, which is called polymorphism. However, since on the left-hand side, you have Player *player, but on the right-hand side, you could have SimplePlayer or HumanPlayer, which can only be determined during runtime. So, the base class, Player must be virtual. Otherwise, your SimplePlayer and HumanPlayer cannot inherit from Player, for they cannot override non-virtual base class functions.. . . Yes. The details are on p3 spec page. SimplePlayer has a strategy to play the game, and HumanPlayer takes input from the users.. . . Because your SimplePlayer and HumanPlayer inherit from Player, they can have their own member variables and functions.

Please keep the followups related to questions in this post only..  . Q: How does the checkpoint work for this project?. A: See @2336. . Q: I've never played Euchre before, how do I learn the rules of the game?. A: Pages 2-5 of the spec detail the rules of ""EECS 280 Euchre"". Also, a staff member from prior semesters made a video tutorial a few years ago that may be helpful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jGJ0NRcrc. 0:33 Dealing. 1:55 The Upcard / Making Trump Round 1. 5:35 Making Trump Round 2. 7:20 Leading the First Trick. 8:20 The Other Players Play Cards in the First Trick. 10:58 Deciding who Wins the First Trick. 11:24 Leading the Second Trick. 12:00 Playing the Rest of the Hand. 20:30 Scoring. 21:23 Determining Whether Another Hand should be Played - Ending. . Q: Can I add helper functions while implementing the Player classes?. You are allowed to use helper functions, but these helper functions should not change the interface of the class. So within your implementations of the class's member functions, feel free to call helpers. But in your test files, you should not assume that these functions exist (because you should not alter the interface for the classes). This also applies in your euchre driver as well! e.g. If you add a helper function to the simple player class, you can use it within that class, but you can't use it in the driver since it won't be part of the Player interface!.  . This is especially important because when we run your test cases against an intentionally buggy solution, that solution will not have your specially defined helper functions! So just use the interfaces of each class when you test them.. . Q: Why am I getting a compiler error for calling sort? . Note that the sort function modifies the hand. You cannot modify member variables in a const function, so you'll receive a compiler error you call sort in a const member function.. . You shouldn’t need to sort using card less. When you print the hand in order it should be sorted using the < operator. You could sort with card less when determining what action to take, but you should be able to find the min/max card in the hand without sorting. You could use a functor to sort using card less, but those are only covered later in the course. Generally: if you need to use sort, just the default one will be fine..  . Q: Why am I passing euchre public test, but failing euchre public test with solution card, pack, and player?. This means that when your euchre.cpp is run with the instructor solution implementations of card, pack, and player you produce incorrect output. This likely means that you're making an incorrect assumption about what functionality should go in card/pack/player versus in the game of euchre. For example, make sure that you're not printing output in player.cpp that should be printed in euchre.cpp. .  . Q: Why won't pack.in open in pack public tests when running on Xcode?. Click on the name of your scheme in the toolbar at the top left, Edit Scheme > Options > Enable ""Custom Working Directory"" and press the little folder icon. Pick the folder that contains your code along with pack.in. This will ensure that the file is visible to your executable. This is usually not a problem, and we are investigating the issue..  . Q: How do I debug and add in command line arguments with XCode/VSCode/VS?. Follow this link  and click on your specific IDE, then click on the ""Arguments and options"" subsection..  . Q: Should I be printing the incoming arguments from the command line?. Yes, according to the spec: ""First, print the executable and all arguments on the first line. Print a single space at the end, which makes it easier to print an array."". . Q: Do I need to worry about the human player doing (insert illegal move) during the game?. No, in accordance with the spec you can assume that a human player will follow the rules of the game and will not attempt to cheat.. . Good luck and happy coding!. . extraorary"|930|1|active|||0
kz7ys9hbjr17lq|image_get_pixel crabster|I am calling Image_get_pixel function in compute_energy_matrix function in processing.cpp.. As required, I have asserted. 0 < width && width <= MAX_MATRIX_WIDTH. 0 < height && height <= MAX_MATRIX_HEIGHT. in Image_get_pixel.. . The compute_energy_matrix works fine for dog, but it hits assertion fails on Image_get_pixel for the crabster. Any advice would be appreciated.|94|0|active|A good strategy would be to use the visual debugger and work backwards from the failed assertion. . You might find that your Image channel matrices have very odd widths and heights. Make sure to initialize these when you initialize an image.||0
