Thank you!|73|0|active|We’re not allowed to see exactly what the tests are, but it sounds like it tests your driver in the event of a tie between two equal log probability scores. Your program should have picked the first label alphabetically in that case.||0

The output is identical but mine cuts off at around 312th line.. . . Which is confusing as the same implementation works perfectly fine on CAEN and on my machine.. .

l26mzmq44u84mj|Error while creating main|. I'm not quite sure what this means, it seems to be a problem with my constructor...|60|0|active|Members are initialized in declaration order, regardless of the order they appear in a member initializer list. In your case, debug is declared above testFile, so it'll be initialized earlier. That means this line of code is a little misleading as written, since one would expect initializers to act from left to right. The compiler issues a warning to discourage this.. . You can get rid of this warning by reordering the three member initializers.||0
l26mzam65w518k|What is the CAEN issue?|". . . My code works on VScode but gives the output shown above only when tested through CAEN, but I don't understand why. The only difference that I know of is that initializing variables can differ between compilers, but I don't think that is the issue. From what I've seen through testing, the problem lies in an incorrect log-probability and incorrect number of examples trained. The function ""ReadingOutput"" I provided in a screenshot above is where I think the issue is coming from, but I still can't determine what is causing the issue. Any help or ideas would be much appreciated. Also, I've included my functions used to compute log-prior and log-likelihood though I don't think the problem lies there. I also have an autograder submission with this code if you want to check it out.. "|7|0|private|Resolved.||1
l26luscs8h5380|What to do if my partner never does work?|Long story short.. I had a partner. My partner worked on Map.h, I worked on BST and the test. I finished early and got working on the driver function.. My partner still had some trouble with Map.h so I just continued to work on the driver function.. . Fast forward to today. I've uploaded part of my work to autograder, and my partner accepted my invite already. I've finished BST, BST tests, and the driver function all by myself. I uploaded all the files to my gitlab repo which my partner is a maintainer as well. So far, my partner has never uploaded their code to gitlab. My partner shrugged it off as having trouble with a function. I shrugged it off as well as from my understanding, map.h was very difficult.My partner has not responded to me since yesterday. Gitlap repo still has not been updated with map.h and the project is finished over is 4 hours.I'm planning on doing the map.h file right now just in case. Who knows, maybe my partner really is busy and will upload map.h soon.But in the case where I had to finish the entire project myself, I do not want my partner to ride on my work without contributing..

l26dqokvs3t3w2|Error Output Timing|"Our code right now works correctly, but I just noticed that if the second file would not be able to be opened, then it goes through the process of learning from the first file before printing the error that the second file cannot be opened.

Also, a much less important question: the spec says to specifically use ( cout << ""Usage: main.exe TRAIN_FILE TEST_FILE [--debug]"" << endl; ) when printing the error. We did it a slightly different way using the private variable of a FileError class but it still prints exactly as it should.

We are incorrectly predicting the log probability, however, in the large set we predict more accurately than the spec, and in the medium set, we predict not accurate enough. While debugging we found a few potential bugs such as not accounting for the bags of words model, and instead looking at all words including duplicates.

Then it prints the right thing and exits the program by returning a non-zero value, but the error message is not the only thing that was printed. Is this a problem?

l2500mp6f383al|what’s the point of using size_t|so it’s my understanding this is the “unsigned-long” type that we usually get compiler warnings about. what is the motivation for having this type in the stdlib?|70|0|active|I have to correct that `unsigned long` does not guarantee to be 64 bits. In C++11, `unsigned long` is at least 32 bits, which means it could still be 32 bits. But `unsigned long long` guarantees to be 64 bits. So, in 64 bits machine, `std::size_t` could be `unsigned long long`.. . The reason that `std::size_t` exists in C++ mainly for logic self-consistency. The return type of `sizeof` operator returns a prvalue of `std::size_t`. It implicitly guarantees `sizeof` operator can evaluate any size of objects as long as the machine supports it. And the return value must be **at least** as large as the maximum size, which could be $$2^{64}$$ in 64 bits machine.. . ![Screen_Shot_2022-04-18_at_13.54.59.png](/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&prefix=paste%2Fke97zxvroac2cg%2Fb3330d15b2972c46e3d9c4b4b2bab528e2bb45e0ecb342889ddb1176ab9c76f8%2FScreen_Shot_2022-04-18_at_13.54.59.png). . Another reason we use `std::size_t` is for self-explanation. `std::size_t` can tell others who read your code this variable controls index or size.. . Also, last but not least, `std::size_t` can be used for portable reasons. For example, if your code was written in 32 bits machine, but 10 years later, the whole world upgraded to 64 bits system, you need to upgrade your program. If you use `int`, your code might not be portable. But `std::size_t` guarantees it can support 64 bits system(use more than 4GB RAM).. . However the common practice is to have a `size_type` in a ADT instead of `std::size_t`. So the true `size_type` of `std::vector` is actually `std::vector::size_type` instead of `std::size_t`. It allows `__uint128_t` to be a valid `size_type`, which is a 128 bits unsigned integer type provided in most compilers.. ||0

When I do this to test my code, the first while loop gives of values but the second one does not.|51|0|active|"It should add the values to the map for the first while loop. However, it will read in one line at a time, assign those values to the accompanying keys (""tag"", content"", etc), and then will reassign the value of the same keys when reading in the next line. This means we lose access to the previous line tag and content.. . When you read in the same csvstream again into a different map, it won't read anything in. fin will keep a pointer (in the class) to the line it is on. So it knows it reaches the end, when the pointer points to the end. This pointer doesn't reset when it hits the bottom, so when you try to read it in again, it will first see the pointer to the bottom and know there is nothing else to read in.

l22hxrb4o7018z|Iterating map of map for given label &amp; word|I made a map of map that looks like this. map <string, map<string,int> labelWords. which is basically <label, map<word,int> == frequency of each word associated with a given label.

My understanding is: . . . log prior probability is how probable it's to have a label. (Done for training & testing files)log prior probability is displayed as the log-probability score.. . log likelihood probability should be calculated of every unique word per each label. (done for training & testing files). . the log likelihood probability can be stored for better efficiency (I think) in a map<string, map<string, double>> where the key is the label, and inside the value the key is the word and the value is the log-likelihood probability.. . . /////. . This is as far as I believe I have an understanding (I have no clue about how the predictions should be made right now)|144|2|active|"I am pretty sure this is the way it should be understood:. . Log probability refers to the entire sum given in the spec (the very first equation in the ""Predicting a Label for a New Post"" section). It represents the probability of a label given the contents of a post.. . So log probability of a certain label = log prior + log likelihood.. . Log prior is simply the first term of the sum in the log probability, and log likelihood is the sum of all the terms that come after (the ones that depend on unique words w_n). The log probability score should therefore just be displayed as the log probability score, or the sum of these two ^^ and not just the log prior like you mentioned in (2).. . We are trying to calculate the probability (represented by the log probability) of every label given a set of words, and choosing the highest out of probabilities. So we would need to compute the log probability of every label from the training set given the post, or the testing data, following the guidelines in the spec about which equation to use in which scenarios. The words we would use in the log calculations for each label are the words from the testing set because we want to find the probability of a label given those words.. . I don't know about (4).

I'm writing this as a private post as recommended by multiple IAs after my partner and I have been unable to solve the problem we are having across many IA Office Hours sessions.   Currently the overall  issue we are having is that our code seems to be working fine when copied to caen and run with a set of training and testing data.  When we run our code in caen, the porgram outputs the all of correct data.  and prints successfully as shown below. . . Also, when we run this program in caen, it says that there are no memory leaks and that all heap blocks have been freed as shown below:. . . . However, when we submit our  files to the Autograder the ""Main Public Tests"" compile but all fail in a similar way.  None of the ""test data"" gets printed and we see a valgrind error, an example of the pair of failed output and the valgrind error that the AG throws at us can be seen below:. . A similar valgrind error occurs in the ""Main public small debug"" test where there is a valgrind error that then causes the ""testing"" data to not be printed, with the help of IAs in OH we saw that line 131 in our main.cpp seemed to be a common problem across the valgrind errors for different test as both the ""bug"" and ""no debug"" paths of our program run thru this line eventually. Below is a code snippet of line 131  and its surroundings.  It seems as if the indexing using maxIndex into ""tag_probabilities"", which is a vector that corresponds to the probabilities for the tags for a given post.  We have tried using [] and .at() for this, but neither have worked for AG submissions.    . . . We  thought we could be going out of bounds with our maxIndex, but then we realized through debugging with IAs that this couldn't  be our problem because will be initalized within the acceptable range each time due to the code shown below:. maxIndex will simply take the index of the greatest value in tag_probabilities.. . We are asking for any extra help from IAs that may be experienced with Valgrind errors because we have been stuck at this point for days with no progress on the issue and are lost on what to do about this after going to many OH sessions with that unfortunately offered no resolve.  Any help would be appreciated.  Our uniqnames are ""elkinb"" and ""zakh"" if you would like to take a look at our last autograder submit to get a better feel for our code's structure.  Thank you.  . .

I am getting bad access with this line of code and I can't figure out what the problem would be. Any help is appreciated, thank you!|60|0|active|Bad access indicates an attempt to read or write to a memory location your program does not own. Looking closely at this line, we see a dereference taking place. The program tries to follow the pointer at argv[1] (which represents the second command-line argument) to read the characters there. How could this be bad access?If you ran the program without any command-line arguments passed in, then argc would be 1, and argv[0] would be the last string (C-style) in argv, which means the access of argv[1] is out-of-bounds. This shows that argv[1] could be out-of-bounds, and your program needs to be able to handle that situation gracefully. Check argc before accessing argv.||0

Is that related to my algorithm? |169|0|active|Hm, yeah, i’d have to guess it’s your algorithm. here’s a quote from the spec:While efficiency is not a primary goal for this project, you should aim for your code to run the largest test case above in no more than a minute. Some common causes of slowdown you should avoid:Processing a post more than once (including reading it more than once or saving all the data in a vector).Iterating over a map to find something rather than using [] or find().Passing strings, pairs, or containers by value.Iterating by value in a range-based for loop.Refer to the Project 2 perf tutorial for instructions on how to use the perf tool to identify slow functions.Basically, I’d make sure my code uses operator & in range-based for loops and functions and stuff involving strings, pairs, and containers  (so it won’t uselessly copy values), and I’d be sure I’m not saving data the spec doesn’t ask you to save, and to use operator [] to get info from maps. Idk how to use perf and don’t really have advice for that, but maybe you’ll find it useful.||1

For example, if you have some function that finds the minimum (it's actually the closest to zero, but the absolute value of the one you want will be the min) log probability score and you're iterating through your labels alphabetically (which you should already be doing), then your min/compare function wouldn't evaluate to true anyways and would leave the first value and therefore label as the correct label.. . As far as testing it, you could just create like two different labels with the same (or none at all) words and make sure that the first (alphabetically) label is chosen.||0

My understanding is that you read in the testing csv file one line at a time, getting the unique word for that line, and passing the unique words from that line into the calculation function.. . 1.

This is because the log likelihood is dependent upon the total number of times a word appeared across many different labels. The purpose of the training file is to calculate the frequency that a word appears and use that to determine the probability of the word appearing in the test data. The training data will give you a word and then you must determine the likelihood it is contained in a post with each of the found labels (found in training).. . Hope this helps!||0

You're right the csvstream object will throw an exception with the right error message we want for this project, however that message is placed *inside* the exception that gets thrown. It won't print the message on its own, and if you don't catch this error, it will crash your program with an uncaught exception.. . In order to actually print it and end your program gracefully, you need to have a try/catch block that prints out the exception message (which you can access using `e.what()`) to cout as the github example does here: https://github.com/awdeorio/csvstream#error-handling. . Another option if you don't want to use try-catch blocks is to make use of the fact that you can construct csvstreams from ifstreams, meaning you can create the ifstream on the files you need to open and check if they're open the usual way before passing them to the csvstream.||0

This works, but because of how searching with brackets works with maps, it inserts the word it couldn't find, which I don't want it to do. I believe the solution is to use .find(), however, I can't seem to figure out the syntax for it."|134|0|active|You have a few options here.. . One, change the structure. Instead of map<K1, map<K2, V>>, consider using map<pair<K1, K2>, V>. This is only a feasible solution if there is no meaningful distinction between a key k1 being absent from the structure and k1 being associated with an empty map.. . Two, find twice:. . auto const it1 = myMap.find(k1);. assert(it1 != std::cend(myMap));    // or however you'd like to handle this case. auto const& inner = it1->second;. auto const it2 = inner.find(k1);. assert(it2 != std::cend(second));    // again, handle lookup failure however you need to handle it. auto const& value = it2->second;. . This is more in line with the question as you originally posed it.. . Three, use the std::optional monad in C++23:. . template <typename Map>. std::optional<typename Map::mapped_type> get(Map const& map, typename Map::key_type const& key) {.     if (not map.contains(key)) {.         return std::nullopt;.     }. .     return map.at(key);. }. . get(myMap, k1).     .and_then([&k2](auto const& map) { return get(map, k2); }).     .or_else(/* Default value for use in the case of lookup failure goes here */);. . You can omit the .or_else(...) if what you want is either the mapped value or no value. This approach has the same caveat as the first approach—there's no distinction here between the lookup failure happening in the outer map or in an inner map. Use std::optional::transform instead of std::optional::and_then if this is undesirable.. . Four, use std::map::at and catch an exception if one is thrown. This is very straightforward—myMap.at(k1).at(k2)—if you don't need to distinguish between k1 being absent in myMap and k2 being absent in myMap.at(k1).. . There are certainly more approaches you can take. Implementing the Either monad adds to the third option the ability to indicate whether lookup failure occurred in the outer map or in the inner map more elegantly than nesting std::optional<std::optional<V>>. This list is far from comprehensive, but hopefully something in it steers you toward a solution.||0

l1spqeff2928d|Why do we separate functions into impl &#43; normal?|Why does P5 separate functions into the implementation/static function and the normal one?|74|0|active|Due to the recursive nature of the implementation functions, these functions have the root Node of the tree (or subtree) as the first parameter. If we made these public, the user would not be able to use them since the `root` member and `Node` class of our tree our private, so they would not be able to pass the root in. So, we create a public member function that calls the implementation and passes in the private `Node *root`.||0

"|167|0|active|`read_csv_line` is a helper function in `csvstream.h`, and it is declared `static` so you cannot use it outside of that file. Instead you should be creating a `csvstream` object from your input file stream and read off of that.. . There is some great documentation here: https://github.com/awdeorio/csvstream#example-1-read-one-column. . In that example they construct `csvstream` from a filename, but you can also construct it from an istream (i.e, your file input stream). ||0

Thank you!|7|0|private|"The address sanitizer error you're getting might be a little misleading, at least its talking about a ""misaligned address"" which I don't think is the issue here. What's more likely is that you're accessing an invalid pointer on line 407 - I'd try running the compile check in your visual debugger and stepping over until the insert where this error is coming from (looks like on line 44 of the compile check). As you go through the find function, make sure you're looking at the values of variables to check if they seem reasonable/aren't suspicious given what the tree is supposed to look like at that point.. . A possible reason for accessing an invalid pointer is not properly setting the left/right pointers of new nodes you create.. . Also, I would revisit the recursive case for your find_impl function - right now, you're making two recursive calls, but find_impl is supposed to be *tail recursive*. Also, you're not using the return value of either of those recursive calls, so they aren't necessarily doing anything. Instead, consider if we need to make more than one recursive call, or if there's some way to know which sub tree to look in, and also how you should use the return value of the recursive call!"||0

Thank you!!|5|0|private|I think you're going in the right direction! Here's my advice:. 1. Try to simplify your cases as much as possible, starting with just a simple base case and a recursive case. .     1. In the base case, you want to handle the situation for the simplest possible tree (like you're doing right now in the original screenshot you posted)..     2. In the recursive case, try making it just one big else block, and then adding more if statements *inside* that else block - that should hopefully simplify your logic a little bit. This is where you have to make a recursive call in some way.. . 2. Consider most basic situations you'll need to handle in the recursive case - ultimately you need to decide what recursive call to make, on which of your subtrees. That will guide what you put in the big else-branch recursive case. . 3. Try watching the BST walkthough video! They talk about an approach to implementing min_greater_than_impl that would be helpful and is along the lines of this advice!||0

For example:. ```. int test(int a) {.     if(a == 0){.         return 0;.     }. }. ```. This code will fail to compile because the function requires to return an integer, if a is not zero, then the function will return nothing.

l1pxdn0myayxj|delete in destroy_nodes_impl|After we deleted the root node, on the debugger panel it shows that the current node is now storing a datum of random number, and what's more interesting is that the left stores an invalid address whereas its right is a nullptr. Even we intentionally set node = nullptr after the delete keyword, after we exited the destroy_nodes_impl function, it would just go back to the previous case where the datum is random and its left storing a bunch of invalid addresses. Why is that the case?. . I believe it's the case that when we delete the root node, that node should be set to a nullptr so that it would not cause any undefined behaviors if we were to use that node again in other functions. . . |126|0|active|From this screenshot, it seems that `node` here is a local variable, and you claim to have set `node = nullptr` perhaps in `destroy_nodes_impl` right after `delete` (wording's a little ambiguous). One possible reason is that since the `node` you set to `nullptr` in `destroy_nodes_impl` was a local variable of `destroy_nodes_impl`, that variable got destroyed when `destroy_nodes_impl` finished, which means setting it to `nullptr` didn't have any effect outside the function, especially on a local variable of the function that called `destroy_nodes_impl`.. . In addition, it sounds like this occurred inside the copy assignment operator. That operator destroys the nodes of _this_ BST and then copies the nodes from _another_ BST. When copying from another BST, it doesn't need to read the existing nodes of _this_ BST. It's okay to have dangling pointers here _as long as you don't dereference them---only assign to them_.||1

If you are still stuck, please post a followups and I can tell you how to catch the rest of the bugs. . 3) Make sure you are also testing the find() function and the assignment operator. . Note: A key to writing good test cases is to not brute force everything, but to think carefully about different scenarios. For example, let's say you make a test case for find() to see if it will find the node to the left of the root. Then you create a different tree and still use find() to find the node to the left of the root. These two test cases are testing for the exact same scenario, so the second is useless. A much better way is to diversify the different scenarios. Use find() to return an Iterator to the left node, then use it to find the root node, right node, bottom right node, the right node to the left node, and finally use it to find a node that does not exist in the tree.||1

I just don’t know what Valgrind does, is all. I remember that on P4 I created one list inside a while(true){} loop and put some stuff in it, and I watched the memory gauge go up. But I don’t know if that was just because I made it do an infinite loop.Also, is MacOS’s Activity Monitor a good tool for finding memory leaks?|100|0|active|Memory use is just how much memory is being used at a particular moment. From the look of it, this is more useful for identifying whether there might be a memory leak than for finding memory leaks. Same goes for the activity monitor—if either shows memory usage climbing when it shouldn't be, that could perhaps indicate a memory leak, but it doesn't show you where.

l1nomwnirxl1vh|insert_impl return|I am a bit confused on what insert_impl is supposed to return. Should we be checking in our tests some way that when we insert a node the original node is being returned?. . I am also wondering how we are supposed to attatch a new node to its parent without having multiple base cases. I currently have one base case checking for null and that is where I insert my new node, but at this point I could either attatch it to the left or right side of the root, but won't this be different depending on the situation?. Should I add more base cases to account for this?|148|0|active|In general, I would avoid having too many base cases because it can make your recursion harder to reason about (since likely you're looking too deeply at the children of your Nodes, where instead we'd prefer to let the recursion handle all of that work below our current Node when we can). Some of the base cases might also just be unnecessary, since you can cover that situation with other base cases. I'd say for this project, one base case is enough for most of the functions, but some might require two. So again in general, its better to have fewer base cases and let the recursion fall through to those cases (although we really have no way of checking that, so if you have something that works and makes sense, that's good too!). . Regarding insert: it can definitely be a weird recursive function to implement! Try to follow the effects as closely as possible - they spell out into your base and recursive cases really nicely!:. ```. Base case.   // EFFECTS : If 'node' represents an empty tree, allocates a new.   //           Node to represent a single-element tree with 'item' as.   //           its only element and returns a pointer to the new Node.. . Recursive case.   //           If the tree rooted at 'node' is not empty, inserts.   //           'item' into the proper location as a leaf in the.   //           existing tree structure according to the sorting.   //           invariant and returns the original parameter 'node'.. ```. Note how the base case doesn't describe anything about attaching a Node to its parent - so to emphasize, the key idea here is that you shouldn't be attaching a Node *to its parent*, rather, you should have the parent Node do that work. When you return a Node, you're returning that as the result of the previous recursive call that you made from the parent Node - that's where you can have the parent Node attach that to itself as its child.. . Its definitely a bit weird, so feel free to follow up!||1

I'm struggling to understand how to compare the root node to every value in the left/right subtrees. If the invariant is being broken, the max / min functions might not return the actual min or max of the subtree. Does this function appropriately check every value, or am I missing something? Is there a way to store the value of the root node I'm looking at so that I can compare it to every value of the subtrees?|10|0|private|You are right, when the sorting invariant is broken, the max / min function might return the wrong node. We can use this to our advantage though. Lets say we have a tree structured like this:.                1.           2        3.       0         2      4 . . The minimum of the left subtree from 1 will be 0 and the maximum of the left subtree would be 2. We know this breaks the invariant because nothing in the left subtree can be greater than the root, and 2 > 1. We can then return false and we don't need to keep on searching. Lets say the issue was a bit farther down in the tree:.                1.           0        3.                 4      5. . The sorting invariant will pass on root 1 because the min of the right tree is 3. However, when the recursive calls on node 3, making node 3 the root, the sorting invariant fails. The left subtree of 3 has a max of 4 which breaks the invariant.. . Hope this helps!. ||0

An example is lets say you call node, then node->left, then node->right where it hits its base case. The stack of node->right is returned. After the function ends, we move to the node->left stack call. It has accesses to node->left and whatever node->right returned. Once the node->left stack call is finished, we then move to the very first stack created, the node stack call. In this stack call we have access to node, the original node, and whatever the recursive call, node->left, returned.. . Hope this helped!!||1
l1n0g88bb9j6mf|delete node|"Right now, I have ""delete node"" to delete the nodes in destroy_nodes_impl (as in, I recurse and then I delete and then delete root). However, after this line, when I look at the debugger, then datum of that deleted node goes to a random number but the pointer is still pointing to a memory address. Should I be repointing the pointer to a nullptr? Or am I supposed to do something else to get the pointer to null? "|106|0|active|You don't have to set the pointers to null, as long as you ensure they aren't used again. However, it's good practice to get rid of dangling pointers by setting the pointers equal to null after you delete them. ||1

I am getting this error in my check_sorting_invariant_impl I think it means that I'm trying to dereference a nullptr but I'm not sure how to fix it? . . Thank you!. |150|0|active|If you know which test case check_sorting_invariant is being called from when it segfaults, you can set a breakpoint in that function and step through with your debugger. When you're going through with the debugger, keep track of what the variables are doing (should be in either the left side of the screen or the bottom depending on IDE), and you should be able to see where you're trying to dereference a nullptr. . . Once you find that, you can set breakpoints in other parts of the program where you think it might be modifying or setting the ptr to a nullptr incorrectly and use the debugger there as well to follow the logic step by step. Hopefully that helps!||0
l1mymnhjqny6kt|map.h comparator|I'm a little bit unsure on where to start with the comparator. I understand that maps consist of two data types and they should align with the parameters of the comparator, but beyond that, should I be writing a function definition for bool operator() then compares these values? Should my comparator parameters only bt the first data type (key type) and then have two of these because it's a comparison? Any guidance would be appreciated!|268|0|active|The comparator is like a functor. So yes, the first parameter should be the first thing to compare and the second parameter is the second thing to compare. Those would be the only parameters as that is the only things being compared. It also should have a member variable of Key_compare type because that determines what type of comparison will be called between the two parameters. You can use this member variable to compare the two parameters. In this project, we are using the std::less<>. When you create the member variable, you are creating an object of the comparison type. A function call of the two parameters - ex compare(a,b) - would return a true or false, which is what we would like to return for the map operator() overload.. . Hope this helps!||0
l1my740d38k5py|Compile error|I'm getting this compile error for my check tree invariant function that I don't understand. This is my BinarySearchTree.h. For my check invariant function I have two helper functions called  check_lesser_tree and check_greater_tree.

l1my6bx07xk2ci|How do I deallocate the BST I have in map?|See title.  Do I need to worry about this?|143|1|active|short answer: nokinda slightly longer answer: no, you don’t have to deallocate the memory for Map.h’s BinarySearchTree. that’s why we made a custom destructor implementation in BinarySearchTree.h; that way any given BST made from our header will automatically allocate as much memory as it needs and deallocate the memory at the end of the lifetime of this BST. If we DIDNT implement the custom dtor, then this would be a problem (memory leak since we’d never get rid of useless Nodes) and it wouldn’t even really be a problem that we could solve in Map.h because Nodes are private and so is the root Node I think. All the dynamic memory activity that starts in BinarySearchTree.h should end in BinarySearchTree.h; anything that gets created with new in that file should get destroyed  with delete. Trying to new that stuff in BinarySearchTree.h and delete it in Map.h probably wouldn’t even work.EDIT: Looked into it a little more and doubling down on that answer. You add the BST private member in Map.h yourself. You’d only really have to delete the BST from Map if you new’d one in Map, and you could only new a BST if you made the BST member pointer and my gut feeling is that that would be unnecessary and confusing considering the BST already uses dynamic memory under the hood. Other than that, your destroy_nodes_impl() implementation should take care of all the nodes (it’s called in the destructor). ||0

For anyone else having similar memory leak issues, a common problem is creating a `new Node` in `insert_impl` regardless of if you're in the base case or the recursive case.

l1l04g8lfoo2oq|operator[] function|Sorry if this post is kind of long, but my main question is at the end. I tried to explain what I was thinking, but that obviously can make this post a lot longer.  . . Within the map.h file, if I want to implement the operator[] function, I know that one of my goals is to search through the tree to see if I can find a node with a key equal to the key passed in as one of the function parameters of the operator[] function. This makes me think that I will probably have to call the find(query) function implemented in BinarySearchTree.h on the tree member variable that I have added to the map.h class (line 123). The find(query) function calls find_impl(node, query, less) where less is a comparator used. My thought process was along the lines of the following logic:. . if(tree.find(k) != end()){. // return by reference the value associated with key. }. else . {. // insert a new key with a value-initialized map value . // return a reference to that mapped value. }. . My question is how can I pass k as an argument to the find function. The reason I am wondering if this is an issue is because the find_impl function makes use of the less comparator which often has the structure along the lines of less(node->datum, query). However in this case my query would just be a key where as node->datum should be a pair (an object that consists of both a key and a value). This makes me confused if I can even use tree.find(k) but I do not know how else to search through the tree and find a node with the same key value as the key passed in to the operator[] function. |10|0|private|"One suggestion is to use Map's insert function to implement the [] operator since the behavior of the insert function is very similar.

If you do want to reason about the recursion in that much detail, this might help: When you make a recursive call, you're entering an entirely new stack frame/function call, meaning you're leaving the previous version of the function call in an intermediate spot where there's still work to be done. That means you've sort of dropped a pin at that spot in the tree. That also means returning from a lower recursive call is how we ""go back up"" the tree, returning to where you put a pin in that function (and when the `node` parameter seemingly goes back to what it was before - in reality, this node parameter is a *completely separate variable* from one recursive call to another, so it never really changed or got lost even if it might look like that in our debugger).. . A perspective that helps a lot more with writing recursive functions is the recursive leap of faith method - there's a slide near the end of my lab slides that has a few things to remember to help yourself get in that mindset: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kM_OLcMydK8LrQorLfAZDAIUM0LmpySCh4hixCZ18uY/edit?usp=sharing. So don't think about moving to a different spot in the recursion - instead, just consider what work you have to do for this particular node in the recursive case, and don't look at the values of your left/right child - let the recursive call handle doing the work. . . Another piece of advice (although I'm not sure if you're exactly doing this in your code) - keep your base cases simple. Avoid looking to see if your left or right children exist - instead, let the nullptr base case handle that. Its much better to fall down into that case and come back up, rather than having a bunch of complex logic in your recursive case to short-circuit the recursion (for insert, that would mean checking to see if your left child doesn't exist, and if so, creating a node for that spot - instead, let it fall down into the base case)."||1

If you have an Iterator in Map.h, and want to check if its what you're looking for, you can't use `==` because that's assuming the `Key_type` type has that operator defined (which we can't assume). Instead, we only have `Key_compare` to compare two values of type `Key_type` - if you needed to check if two keys were the same, you would have to use that comparator. I'm not sure why your IDE is upset about the syntax with `it->first` and `p.first`, it looks like it should be okay just based on this snippet so I'd have to see more to tell for sure.. .

That memory could have gotten leaked at any point in any code run after that line.. . I would definitely start looking in the insert function (because the error could be there too), but if nothing turns up there, you should look at all of the functions run after the insert on line 13 in the `bst_public_test` test case, including the destructor. It can be tedious, but drawing out a picture of the tree with circles for nodes and arrows for left/right pointers as you step through the test case can help identify leaked memory - you just need to be really careful about *only* updating arrows when you set them in your code, and *always* drawing a new circle whenever you call `new Node` in any function||0

However, because we're storing the data in our BST where every single node stores a pair containing a Key *and* a Value, in order to use the BST `find()` function (to find the Node containing the pair whose key matches the key we're looking for), we need to provide a pair to look for.. . Basically, we're given a value of type `Key_type` but to use the BST `find()` function, we need a *pair* containing (Key_type, Value_type). The value you put in this pair doesn't matter, so the hint is suggesting you use `Value_type()` (this exact syntax) to default construct a value of type `Value_type` to put in the pair.. .

The issue could be in a couple of places, but it would be fastest to step through this test case with your debugger and examine what the tree looks like, and why its isn't able to increment the iterator at this point.

If you're referring to creating an iterator to the first element in the BST, you can do so using `begin()` - this is already implemented for you.. . If you're referring to creating an iterator to the first element in Map, note that the Map Iterator is defined to be the same thing as the BST iterator - because your Map is built on top of a BST, the beginning of the Map would naturally just be the beginning of the BST!. . You do not need to implement the less comparator inside of BST. If you look in the BST compile check, the comparator is something implemented by the user of the BST outside of the class, so it would be something created in the test cases (if you're using a custom type. By default, the standard library `less` is used, so you don't need to create a comparator for creating a BST of ints, or doubles, or any of the standard types).||0

However the Requires clause of insert_impl says that it inserts with respect to the invariants ( it inserts it in a sorted manner basically ), but we may need to copy UNSORTED trees, correct? In such a case I don't think we'd able to use insert_impl within copy_impl. . . I guess I'm trying to ask if we'll ever need to copy an unsorted tree, because then the implementation of copy_impl would have to ignore the sorting invariant |286|0|active|I do not understand what is an *Unsorted Tree*. Tree is always sorted. The structure of BST guarantees the inorder traverse will give you sorted data.. . I do not think you should use `insert_impl` in `copy_impl`. Here are a few reasons. . . 1. RME asks for ***EXACTLY the same structure***. However, `insert_impl` does not guarantee that.. 2. You cannot infer the order of insertions purely based on any kind of traverse. You must have at least two traverses(e.g. inorder+preorder) to re-construct the same tree structure. ( I think this is how AG tests your `copy_impl`, and why we expose inorder and preorder traverse in public interface).. 3. You are required to write a tree recursion. . . Do not think too much about `copy_impl`. This function only needs 2 - 5 lines. If you find the correct way to implement, the tree recursion is very elegant.||1

From the spec, it must be a comparator, so it must have an overloaded operator() that takes in two objects and returns a boolean. Next, focus on this line in the spec: ""The overloaded () operator should accept two objects of Pair_type and return whether the key of the LHS is less than the key of the RHS (according to Key_compare)"" (emphasis mine). So, it's saying to compare the keys of the RHS and LHS according the comparator Key_compare and return whether the key of LHS is less than the key of RHS.. .

l1bicyhapvn6f7|What does the less mean in the function headers for project 5?||126|0|active|You can treat `std::less` as a default comparator(a functor used for comparison) in STL. Here is a possible implementation. Also, `= std::less` means that if comparator is not passed-in, we use `std::less` as the fallback/default comparator for comparison.. . ```c+. template. struct less {.     bool operator()(const T &lhs, const T &rhs) {.         return lhs < rhs;.     }. };. ```||0

l1b5vnqrl7qrv|Advice on Starting Traverse Order|I finished the other functions relatively quickly, but this one I'm just confused how to start. From what I've read in the wikipedia links, it seems that the in order prints datum starting from the smallest element and then goes to the largest. However, the issue is that you can't go up the tree, only down. So let's say I use recursion and stuff and go down to the smallest element located on the left branch and print that to oss. Now I am stuck there and have no way of going back up the branch to find the next smallest element. I've tried thinking about how to solve this in so many ways but I just feel very stuck on these two functions. Does anyone have advice?. . Edit: Wait, I think I get it now, so is it because the function is tree recursive and basically searches all the nodes from left branch from the root node and then all the nodes from the right branch? But because it is tree recursive, when all the stack frames from the left branch are gone, we are now at the node we started out with, so while we 'went' to the leftmost node, we still stay at the current node at the same time. This is too weird.|159|2|active|"I think your edit is the exact confusion that a lot of people have with recursion! Its very tempting to think about recursion as ""going down"" the tree to some node every time you perform a function call. The problem is visualizing ""going up"", because that's actually what's going on when we return from a function, and end up in a previous recursive call, and that's not so easy to reason about in your head. . . Instead, you should take the recursive leap of faith: don't follow the recursive call down - instead, ""stay"" at the current node or location in the recursion and just treat the recursive call like any other function call that you assume works properly and returns whatever you need it to. Then, you'll just need to apply that reasoning to all the different cases you could find yourself at in the process of recursion (basically thinking about the base cases and the different recursive cases).. . Specifically for the traversals, the main difference between the three is what order you ""visit"" or ""process"" the current datum in relation to visiting/processing the left subtree or the right subtree (either before both, in between the two, or after both). If you take the recursive leap of faith approach to thinking about recursion, then this definition for the traversals should hopefully feel pretty natural!

l19x0w5drws4vf|Confusion About Tree|Since there is more than one possibility for the structure of the tree, how do we determine what structure is it supposed to be?. For example, these are all valid trees. . but they all have different heights depending on which node you start with. So for our height function, how do we know what should be returned when testing? When we insert something, how do we know the root node? Would it always be determined by the first node we insert?. . (P.s. you can ignore the middle pic, I know for our tree its only supposed to have left and right. This is just an image I found on google)|239|0|active|"A nonempty tree knows its own root. When you perform some operation on such a tree, that root is the one that will be used.. . In general, the useful queries on trees are the ones that return the same thing for any two equivalent trees. Any property that's not identical for equivalent trees is meaningless. Notice that std::set does not provide a height member function, for example.. . Now, just what ""equivalent"" means can vary. In the case of std::set, two trees that contain the same set of elements are equivalent. Some trees—syntax trees, for example—carry information in their shape as well as in their contents, so there's a much more strict sense of equivalence."||1

l16vzuw2c3f738|Project 5 FAQ|"Refer to this post for Frequently Asked Questions regarding Project 5. Please keep the followups related to questions in this post only. The FAQ will be updated as the project progresses, so please check back here before posting a new question!. . Reminder: Project 5 is due Tuesday, April 19th. . Q: I've never worked with maps before.  Where can I get a crash course about map functionality?. A: Staff last semester made a p5 walkthrough video! Check it out here!  In addition, another staff member made this video a few years ago detailing a general overview of what they are and how you can use them.  In addition here is a playlist for additional help related to p5..  . Q: Should I use my Map.h implementation in the driver?. A: DO NOT DO THIS. Your implementation of Map is inefficient, and will cause problems down the road. Use the standard library implementation of map instead. (#include <map>) Great documentation can be found at http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/map/. . Q: I want to test if an Iterator points to a nullptr, how can I do this?. A: You're probably trying to compare the iterator to nullptr like this: ASSERT_EQUAL(iter, nullptr);. Because these two aren't of the same type, the unit testing framework will probably complain. Instead see if you can compare two objects of the same type - Iterator - which have the same value..  . Q: What is less? What is std::less<T>? How do I use less? . A: less is a private member variable of BST.. . It is an instance of a comparator class whose type is Compare. Compare is a template type. std::less<T> is a functor class in the stl that compares two elements of type T using the < operator. By default, Compare will be std::less<T>.. . In the BinarySearch_compile_check.cpp, there is an example of a BST with the default Compare and a BST with a custom comparator. . . . In the first case, the template will be instantiated like . Node *root;. std::less<int> less;. In the second case, the template will be instantiated like . Node *root;. DuckWealthLess less; .  . Q: What could be a cause of incorrect accuracy? . A: Make sure you're properly handling duplicate words. Make sure ties are properly handled. Make sure log-probabilities are not being rounded due to being stored in an incorrect type..  . Q: How do I record ""For each label L and word w, the number of posts with label L that contain w""? . A: You'll need a more complex data structure, since you'll need to store three pieces of information - the label, the word, and the count. There are at least two different ways to do this. Hint: The key type and/or value type of a map can be a class..  . Q: Why do my test cases compile on Caen but not the autograder?. A: Double check that you haven't broken the public interface and added a public function. Also, do not put using namespace std in a header file..  . Q: What's a csvstream and how do I use it? . A: There are three really helpful examples at https://github.com/awdeorio/csvstream..  . Q: Do we need to check for duplicates in our check_sorting_invariants_impl?. A: Your check_sorting_invariants_impl checks for a valid BST. A tree with duplicates is not a valid binary search tree. The most definitive and unambiguous description of the invariant you need to check for is described in the sorting invariants section of the spec. To be extra clear, if you were to call check_sorting_invariants on a tree that has duplicates in the right subtree, it should return false..  . Q: VSCode syntax highlighting is breaking on BinarySearchTree.h and Map.h!. A: This appears to be a bug in VSCode 1.33 regarding default template parameters. We've found a few workarounds, probably the simplest of which is to add a comment to the template declaration:. .  . Q: How fast does my code need to run?. A: You should aim for the large test case to run within a minute or so. For reference, the instructor solution takes about 5 seconds on this test case..  . Q: My code is too slow. What might be the reason?. A: Common sources of slowness include:. . Processing a post more than once (including reading it more than once or saving all the data in a vector).. . Iterating over a map to find something rather than using [] or find().. . Passing strings or containers by value.. . Iterating by value in a range-based for loop.. . pingreaterthan"|1016|2|active|||0
l147x770axt4u1|question about copy_all|I finished this project without using the function:  copy_all. Is it possible? Must we use this function?. . Thank you.|193|0|active|It is possible to implement the project without `copy_all`, though for testing purposes, it might make sense to use it to avoid any bugs. (Since we want to test all our functions we have to implement) Additionally, `copy_all` is meant to reduce any code duplication and help condense certain parts in `List.h`, can you think where and why?||1
l11hhuiqitv6f3|Iterator constructor|I am confused on how to write the constructor for Iterator. In the List_compile_check.cpp, it declares an iterator like this:. . List<int>::Iterator iter = my_list.begin();. so, how would you access the value of my_list.begin() in the constructor in order to assign its value to node_ptr. I read in other posts, you don't need an assignment operator and any of the big three for iterator, so I am confused as to how this would work.. |215|0|active|The `.begin()` part of `List::Iterator iter = my_list.begin();` comes from where you implemented the `begin()` function in your `List` class. Since that function returns an iterator pointing to the first element of your list (you’ll probably need to call the iterator constructor to create one first!), the compile check statement is just assigning that value to `iter`.||0
