kzhnuoe9k8o2ss|Slide 53 of Euchre Clarification|"What does the picture below mean? Does it mean that Alice always plays her lowest ranking card, and if she has two cards of equal rank that are the lowest but one is a trump card or a led card, she chooses the non trump/led card? Also, doesn't she only get to choose the lowest rank card on the condition that she does not have a card of the same suit as the led card? So why then is that ""considered?"". "|96|2|active|Yes, your understanding is correct - given a trump suit and led suit, that will create an ordering of the cards in a player's hand in terms of highest to lowest valued cards (as described in this picture in the spec: https://eecs280staff.github.io/p3-euchre/#value-of-cards), and if the SimplePlayer cannot follow the led suit, they will play whatever the lowest valued card is in their hand.. . You're also correct that there's no real consideration of the led suit in this scenario when the simple player cannot follow suit - in general your thinking should be about ordering cards based on the trump suit and led suit whenever possible, at least for the simple player, and I think that's what this sentence is getting at. But again, Alice doesn't have any cards of the led suit so they'd only be picking between any trump/non-trump cards in their hand ||0

kz99ikr65ma5dq|Project 2 time out|I was working this evening on getting my project to stop timing out on the longer tests on autograder even though they passed when run on my PC. After trying to optimize for a few hours, I realized that it was probably my assert statements (checking the requires clauses) getting called over and over on the larger tests that was causing this. I commented them out and everything worked in Visual Studio, but the warnings for unused functions/variables caused the code not to compile through g++.. . I only lost one point from the public tests from time out, but if more of the private tests time out as well is there any chance of uploading the fixed version? I used all three of my uploads today figuring that out.. . P.S. There is no easy way to run perf on WSL. Apparently it's possible on WSL 2 but you need to download and install it manually from Microsoft's git. This is where most of my time went, and even after upgrading to WSL 2 and installing everything, I still wasn't able to run the executable. I ended up using virtualbox to run linux, cloned my repo and ran perf that way.. . Just figured I should mention this in case you want to update the appendix. I followed these processes, which apparently work most of the time:. Steps to install perf: https://gist.github.com/abel0b/b1881e41b9e1c4b16d84e5e083c38a13.

Every other test passed except for horses when it came to seam carve function, which said timed out. It seems like the general consensus to why this happens is that horses was a big file which is why it is easy to time out. But will the private tests for processing involve images bigger or smaller than horses?|212|0|active|I have no knowledge of the private tests, but the student answer here seems reasonable.

Does that 10/10 come from only the valid test cases, meaning I could delete the false positive test cases and have no issues? Or is it possible that deleting one of the false positive test cases would lower my grade?|126|0|active|False positives indicate you wrote your unit test incorrectly, like asserting the wrong logic (i.e. you have ASSERT_EQUAL(add_integer(2, 2), 3)).. You could get rid the false positive test cases, as your points only come from the valid tests you write.But these false positives also serve as a reminder to make double check you correctly understood and implemented your functions right.||0

kz9048p3t2o6vl|project2|When a pixel is a parameter in a function how do I access the different colors of the pixel because doing color->r gives an error|105|0|active|The operator `->` dereferences a pointer and the accesses a member variable. It is equivalent to doing `(*ptr).`. We do this with `Matrix *mat` and `Image *img` because these are pointers. To access `Pixel` objects, we don’t typically use pointers in the project (for instance, `Pixel color = {0,255,0}` just declares a `Pixel` variable), so you just access the members with the `.` operator. Doing `color->r` would try to dereference `color`, which isn't possible if `color` is an object and not a pointer.||1

You can use pointer arithmetic to avoid these loops. For example: using `ptr - arr` to get the index of `ptr` in `arr`. The `arr` here is the data in Matrix, which is `mat->data`.. .

However, if you don't find them that way, I'd also consider that the `column_start` and `column_end` values shown in the debugger are huge and seem like they must be coming from an out-of-bounds read or uninitialized variable.

At line 28 in my Image.cpp file we are getting an issue and we aren't sure how the istream is causing this. Thank you! |6|0|private|From a quick look, it appears valgrind is complaining that the read operations on that line are somehow using an uninitialized value. You'll get this warning if any part of that line depends on values that are directly uninitialized or were computed based on uninitialized data. The pointers you're working with there are coming from `Matrix_at`, so evidently there's an issue where something used by `Matrix_at` is uninitialized. Take a look at the values used by `Matrix_at` to compute the pointer to the data in the array. Are there any values that could be uninitialized there based on the way the matrices are created and where they're initialized in `Image_init`?. . Or, another general principle that applies here is that you must ALWAYS call `Matrix_init` on a matrix before you're able to use any `Matrix_` functions safely.||0

Thanks!|132|1|active|The source image `crabster.ppm` has a size of $$74\times 45$$, so if you pass $$50\times 45$$ but not $$70\times 35$$, the issue might arise from your handling of `seam_carve_height` in relation to `seam_carve`. I would recommend comparing your logic there to the spec.. . Edit: Check the error from running the test. An assertion for a Requires clause failed. In that case, running the test through the debugger (with no breakpoints) would cause the debugger to stop at the exact moment the assertion failed, which enables you to inspect all the variables at that instant, figure out which ones are incorrect, and trace your logic to how that became incorrect.||1

But your for loop only makes sense/doesn’t crash if you assume the second condition. Otherwise you might try to index into memory beyond the length of seam[].. Additionally, I don’t see any way to verify the second condition. Arrays store no data on their length (they decompose to a pointer) and the only way to check if it was a different length would be to potentially index out of bounds. This is why we pass both arrays and sizes into functions.. . As you’ve exposed with your question, you don’t always have to assert the requires clause. Sometimes it is not possible to assert.

Below are the correct values for cost and seam for dog:. . . . The first value in seam, 1, should correspond to the first line in cost. If this is the case, why is it 1??

I know it should be seam[height - 1] but I'm not sure how to change it.|106|0|active|The size of an array can't be changed after initialize. When you initialize your seam, it should be of size `MAX_MATRIX_HEIGHT` to account for the case when the input image is at max height (500). Ideally, your functions should only access `seam` using index within the range `[0, Image_height)` and you can leave the rest of the seam uninitialized.

Does anyone have any advice or insight on where the best place to look might be, and where I might find the error?|145|0|active|I would say to use a debugger and set breakpoints (perhaps at the start of your find_seam function) and see what variables are changing and what the algorithm is doing vs what you intend it to do. Also, drawing out an picture of how the finding_seam algorithm would potentially work can help with understanding edge cases (like border locations or for when you should stop iterating through rows).  I also highly recommend saying out loud what your code is doing at each line (just like if you were the computer and had to blindly do whatever instructions was listed in your code) to make sure what your code is doing is correct. This may sound silly, but it is a form of debugging (It’s called rubber duck debugging, https://rubberduckdebugging.com/)  :). . Anyways, conceptually, think about the pixels at the borders and which columns a border pixel should only analyze so that it doesn’t look out of bounds in your matrix. Also, think about how after you find the column of the pixel with the min cost, how does the computer know it’s new location in the matrix so it can correctly find the ~column of the pixel with the min cost~ again (ie how does the row and column change each time you iterate through each row when finding the seam). Also, check out the correct outputs for the public tests (such as crabster_seam_correct.txt) and compare it with the output of your algorithm (perhaps using a debugger). Maybe also reread the spec part about the finding the seam function and make sure your following what they say. . . I don’t know if this will help, but just my two cents.||0

The test in the image below has been coming back as a false positive when all the other tests around it (which are functionally identical) are not. Is something wrong with the test? I'm mostly asking just because, as was the case before, my implementation is passing the test but a correct one from the autograder isn't.. . Is it possible for an instructor to look into this?

Also, it's my third to latest submission as when I removed it the issue was gone (which is the confusing part as many other tests here are very similar).. . |128|0|active|A false positive could also mean that the physical test case is incorrect somewhere, meaning the data you hard coded as correct is not the actual correct output.

Specifically where you're seeing it has a size of 31.. . As far as the values being too large past the 25th element, this is actually okay! Note that the data array in Matrix is a fixed size that's 250,000 elements long, because the max width and height we allow is 500. Any matrix you have that's smaller than 500x500 will still store its data in this super long data array, but only as much as it needs. For the dog case, it will use the first 25 spots and initialize those with actual values from dog_cost_correct.txt - everything past it will just be uninitialized, meaning you may have really large random values in the rest of the data array, and the understanding is you'll only read from the valid portion of the array based on the width and height.  ||0

While the rest of the project provides a set of C++ functions that let you resize an image from your program when you have an image object to resize, the new driver program you implement in resize.cpp lets you write something like. . . $ resize.exe dog.ppm dog.out.ppm 4 5. . in your command line instead. The advantage is that this can be done conveniently for multiple different images/sizes without having to recompile a new program each time.. . In order to achieve this, the driver program needs to perform some basic processing and validation of the arguments (provided to the main function through argc and argv), read from the input file, call the seam_carve algorithm, and then write the result to the output file.||0

kz62lv8vc8e17n|Valgrind Invalid read of size 4|My code runs and passes all tests and the AG takes no points off, however, Valgrind indicates that there is a possibility of an error. I believe this means I am reading/writing from/to uninitialized or deleted data. The find_minimal_vertical_seam function passes in a seam[] array as a parameter. I thought this was where the error may have been coming in at, and it probably is, but none of my solutions seem to work.. . When I create the dynamic seam array in seam_carve_width, I delete it at the end of the function. However, this array is then passed into other functions with its now deleted values, which is a problem. To solve this, I removed the delete from the end of that function, and tried to delete the array parameter passed into the final function that it is used in, but that gave me an invalid use of delete error. I also tried setting height to const since I pass that into the array, but that didn't do anything, just tried it because I had no other ideas.. . Basically, I think I have identified the problem, but don't know exactly how to go about fixing it. I know I need to delete the dynamic array I use at some point, and that point has to be after it's done being passed into functions/used, but I am unable to access it then, so I don't know where to delete it at. Unless that's not the problem at all and I'm on the complete wrong track? I didn't lose any points on the AG because of this, but I don't want to lose points on the private tests because of it.. . (this happens for every public test file btw, not just the dog one). . Any help is greatly appreciated!. |173|1|active|It looks like your seam array is allocated to contain 4 entries, even though the test case has a height of 5 pixels. As a result, your find_minimal_vertical_seam and remove_vertical_seam methods access the array past the end. Check your code that decides the size of the seam array and either make it the height of the input image, or the maximum image height.||1

kz5rh29u20e6hc|How to test resize.cpp?|Hey, I’m working on a MacBook in Xcode. I only really know how to work the visual debugger when compiling from Xcode. When using make and ./resize.exe from command line (with the argument for resizing horse.ppm to 400x250), my test fails. When I look at the output file it’s way too small, like both dimensions are less than 100. But, it’s kind of hard to step through and see what’s going wrong because Terminal won’t trigger Xcode’s debug mode when executing the program. I feel like it’s a problem with my seam_carve algorithm instinctually, but I don’t want to break anything that works by just guessing what might be broken between all these functions.So really the main question is if there’s any way to step through my code after providing the command line that executes the whole program.Thoughts, or maybe an instructor could also look at my code on autograder.io?Additional information: Autograder gives an error under Processing_public_test horses: “terminate called after throwing an instance of ‘std::bad_alloc’what(): std::bad_alloc”My code did at some point also tell me something about a memory allocation error. |204|0|active|"I'm not completely versed in XCode, but there is a way to run resize.cpp with arguments in XCode - I'd follow this StackOverflow link https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1698830/giving-command-line-arguments-in-xcode-in-c-program or search up ""give command line arguments xcode"".

kz5rgjpfltu6u4|Seam carve timing out|My seam carve test passes crabster and dog but it times out during horses. I think it has to do with the way I am making the test seam.

Is there a way that I can fix that? . |146|0|active|Initializing an array where the size is determined at runtime is something you can only do with dynamic memory, using the `new` keyword. In other words, you can't really create a normal array with an unknown size (cause the compiler doesn't know what height the image will be until the code is actually run). A workaround to this could be just initializing an array with size `MAX_MATRIX_HEIGHT` (the max height) and just using the values you need!||0

Because dog was a 5x5 image, my understanding is that when I pass my result from remove seam (a 5x5 image with what should be an extra column of repeat values in column 4 - indexed from 0 so 5) it should be compared with another 5x5 image, instead it is compared to a 5x4 image, which, if it were height x width wouldnt surprise me, but in this case the image has a width of 5 and a height of 4!. . I'm confused why we compare to an image with one less row of height.

Be sure to always call `Matrix_init` for a new matrix before using `Matrix_at`, `Matrix_print`, etc. Some errors seem to be caused by uninitialized values which may be a result of not first calling `Matrix_init`. Additionally, be careful about managing dynamic memory properly - any `new` matrix should be deleted. I would start by addressing those test case errors and see if that fixes the issues you are having with running your test cases. Feel free to follow-up with questions!||0

kz5319c81v14n9|test output image function|what do these numbers mean? also, our actual output to that is close, does that just mean our image fill equation is wrong? this is in the image public tests and is the only one we re failing. |108|0|active|Those values are basically PPM format for representing an image. You can read the spec for a really good explanation.. . For the input string:. The P3 shows that it's a plain PPM file, the next two numbers (2, 2) are the width and height of the image, the 255 is the max intensity (it will always be 255 for our images). Those four are always the first four items in PPM format. The numbers following that are basically rgb values for each pixel. You can think of it like every group of three is one pixel, with the first number being the value for red, the second being the value for green, the third being the value for blue. The /t and /n are just whitespace to test whether your code is treating whitespace correctly.. . For the output string:. That's what your code should be printing, after having fixed the whitespace issues from the input string and grouped everything correctly. . If your output is similar, maybe make sure you're reading everything in the correct order and that your variable types are correct?||2

On Crabster this is the assert I'm hitting:. . . |15|0|private|One thing I recommend is to change your variable names to something more meaningful - rather than w and h, try making them cost_width and cost_height instead (same for r and c). That should hopefully make it easier to see if the wrong variables are getting passed into functions.. . For understanding col_start and col_end in that function, you should remember the range is inclusive at the start and exclusive at the end. For example, say I had a 5x5 matrix:. ```. 1 3 3 2 6. 4 5 7 8 3. 8 1 0 6 9. 0 5 4 2 7. 2 6 4 3 6. ```. If I called `Matrix_col_min_value_in_row(mat, 3, 2, 5)` - this would find the column of the min value in row index 3:. ```. 0 5 4 2 7. ```. Looking in the range from column index 2 *up to but not including* column index 5 - in other words, that's columns 2, 3, and 4. So let's add the column indices and mark all the ones we're looking at:. ```. 0 5 4 2 7. ---------. 0 1 2 3 4.     ^ ^ ^. ```. In other words, you need to remember that if you want to look from column index k on the left to column index n on the right, your parameters to this function should be (k, **n + 1**) so n is included.. . Given that, you should examine each of your cases for this find_vertical_seam function and draw out an example Matrix for each case to understand which columns you want to look at.||0

It seems that the autograder doesn't create the output file when it is grading submissions, instead relying on the fact that the open() function creates the output file before writing to it. This is an issue in your program because you use fstream to open files, which by default doesn't create the file if it doesn't already exist.

In other words, your array should be as big as the height of your image. Of course, you're welcome to initialize an array up to the max height (500) and only use a certain amount of those spaces, but thinking in terms of Image height might help you input values from the back to the front.. .

kz4w1jgwlu06yt|Exclusive column_end|Hi! I am wondering about the reason why we choose to make the column_end an exclusive one.  I am trying to answer this by finding that here we assert column_end <= Matrix_width. If here we say column_end < Matrix_width, will it be possible to not exclusive the column_end? I will still write my code following the instruction. Just curious about the reason. Thanks!. |96|0|active|The short answer is it is by convention.. . Long answer:. . Usually, the element after the last element is used as a sentinel. For example, for pointer:. . ```c++. void foo(int *arr, size_t N) {.  int *end = arr + N;.  while (arr++ != end) {.   std::cout << *arr << std::endl;.  }. }. ```. . Later in this semester, you will learn *iterator*. And for the iterator, it has a function called `end()`, which will return the iterator that points to the position that after the last element in the data structure, say`std::vector`. Still remember `std::sort()`? So we do this `std::sort(vec.begin(), vec.end());`, In this example, `vec.end()` is one that is not included in sorting.. . You will see a lot of similar usage in C++ and other languages. If you know python, the `range()` function only returns the values excluding the last one. Also, in Java, the random generator only returns the number in the range excluding the upper bound.. . Also, in p1, you are comfortable with doing this:. . ```c++. std::vector vec = {1, 2, 3};. for (size_t i = 0; i < vec.size(); ++i) {} // < sign is more common than i <= vec.size() - 1 . ```. ||0

kz4cfd7av4c72l|What does a pointer-to-struct point to exactly?|When we declare a pointer to a struct that has many different components (possibly of different types), which address of those components does it point to exactly? I'm asking this since it seems the way we use an arrow to access the member elements of a struct implies that the pointer abstractly points to the struct as a whole instead of a specific address of a component.|61|0|active|The address of the first member variable in that struct.. . Well, I should not explain in this way. Actually, the pointer usually points to the start byte of a data type. For example, for `int`, which has 4 bytes, `int *` points to its first 1 byte. Therefore, the pointer-to-struct does not have any exception, pointer also points to the first byte of it. `struct` or `class` themselves do not have any space in memory. Therefore, it is effectively the same that the pointer-to-struct points to the first member variable. However, remember, the pointer has type `A *` means a pointer to type `A`, it holds both the memory address and the length of data type it points to. So, you can say the memory address the pointer points to happens points to the same memory address as the first element, but they are not the same type, which means the pointer-to-struct never means to point to the first element.. . #### However, it is not always true. It highly depends on ABI. C++ does not have a universally defined ABI.. . ```c++. struct A {.     int a = 10;.     int b = 280;.     char c = 'e. ;};. . int main() {.

From what I understand from the posts, we can initialize our newImage using Image_init where we can make our newImage have a smaller width.. . And then when we copy our newImage back to originalImage, all properties of the newImage are copied over, and the orginalImage will now have the dimensions of the newImage (and therefore our originalImage will not have the extra column).. .

kz3klqx98d713f|dog_removed.correct.ppm values do not match|In the image below, the data values in the debugger are removed_img_correct's red color values. the values to the right, in Notepad++, are the correct RGB values for dog_removed.correct.ppm. As you can see, the values don't match (here we can only see the red values don't match, but it is the same case with the green and blue values). This entire project has gone smoothly thus far, but I have been unable to progress as I cannot figure out why this is. My remove_seam algorithm works correctly and it produces the correct values in the ppm file, but the Image_Equal function fails everytime, because, as seen below, removed_img_correct must not be being read in correctly. Reading in that file uses only instructor provided functions and one student written function (Image_get_pixel). I have thoroughly checked my get pixel function over and over and it passes every test I can think of, yet removed_img_correct is still not being read in correctly. Any help would be greatly appreciated.. |110|0|active|Hm, is it the case that reading in removed_img_correct only uses one student function? Looking at the public test functions (which is kind of a pain to parse through), we initialize removed_img_correct using `load_image()`. Although that is a provided function, it uses your Image_init to read in the ppm file.. . Taking a look at your most recent submission to the autograder, I would definitely take another look at that function - particularly where you're reading in the pixel values. Hope that helps!||1

kz3j5z18lht5mj|What function should I debug if I am failing seam carve on processing_public_tests?|See title.  All other tests are passing up until this test, so I am assuming that would mean all the functions I call in that function work.  Any ideas?|230|1|active|Just a general note for anyone in this situation: You have to be careful, even if all the processing tests up to seam_carve pass for an image in processing_public_tests, its not guaranteed that seam_carve should pass too (even if seam_carve itself has no bugs). That's because processing_public_tests only tests the initial run for each of those functions, where as seam_carve is running those repeatedly. This would be a different case if processing_public_tests were to verify the output of each individual function throughout the seam carve, but it does not.. . Just to further cement that point, take find_vertical_seam for crabster for example - there's only one crabster_seam.out.txt provided in the starter files. However, in an actual seam carve, you would be finding many seams, so if the processing_public_tests were actually verifying each intermediate output, we would have many more crabster_seam.out.txt files for each step.. . So given all that, and that your functions do at least work for the initial carve, there's likely an edge case somewhere in one of your processing functions that causes it to produce incorrect output, throwing off the whole seam carve. To debug this, you have two options:. 1. Write individual test cases for each function targetting specific edges cases. You'll have to write your own ppm files and do the calculations manually to verify the output is correct.. 2. Still come up with possible edge cases for each function, but comb through your code with those situations in mind and reason whether your implementations appropriately handles those ||1

I'd say there's two major things to do:. 1. Write smaller test cases for each processing function. You'll have to write the image .  to test with (something like 4x4 should be big enough) and calculate the correct outputs of each processing function yourself. It'll be a little tedious. 2. Comb through each function and compare it to the spec's directions - question what variables you're using for things like loop conditions, what's getting passed into functions, making sure you're not mixing up rows vs columns, and so on. It helps to have explain your code to someone who can help ask these questions, so you might consider going to office hours to talk over specific functions you're less confident about. .

Long answer: This is actually a fun observation of how memory allocation works (though my understanding o this is surface level at best). `delete` does not really delete the data per-say, but rather it ""frees"" the memory in the heap so that someone else can allocate that memory. When you then `new` a new matrix of the same size, the computer tends to allocate that same chunk of memory as before, which is why you are seeing the same values from before. You should **never** write code that takes advantage of this fact of course, but it is still interesting. In can also sometimes lead to cybersecurity issues."||0

Instead, use the Matrix functions that are part of the interface (e.g. Matrix_width(&img->red_channel), Matrix_at(&img->green_channel, r, c))."""|119|0|active|"This is simply object-oriented programming. For this project you're being asked to use the functions that WE made for accessing data, instead of using the standard library functions for accessing it directly. It just makes codes with a lot of objects and layers easier to conceptualize and understand. You will be marked down on the autograder IF you use standard operators to access a member variable in a .cpp file where that member's struct wasn't defined in the header, AND we wrote functions for accessing that member variable. i.e. NEVER use ""mat→data"" outside of Matrix.cpp, use Matrix_at(). NEVER use ""img→width"" outside of Image.cpp, use Image_width(). It works, but it's not object-oriented.. . The reason you must pass in the image by reference in this given example is simply because the function calls for the address of an Image, not an Image. If you passed in the Image, which is a struct object, when the function expects a pointer to the Image, which is a hexidecimal address, you would get a compiler error. Although, reference-or-no-reference is not really the point of the example. It's telling you to properly use the interface the way we're programming it.. . Think about it. After you're done building a steering wheel into a car, you're not gonna exit the vehicle and directly grab the axles and wheels with your hands just to turn your vehicle to the right.. . In a similar vein, after you've built an interface for interacting with a Matrix, you're not gonna pick directly through the variables and data when you're using a Matrix in an Image object; instead, you should use the functions you built to interact with a Matrix object, because it works in context. Accessing Matrix.data[] with Matrix_at() & row and column format in the Image class will work much more intuitively and easily than using Matrix.data[i]."||0

I'm not sure about this, but if it's four byte aligned, then mat->data would occur at x+8, where x is the address of mat. But if it's eight byte aligned, then mat->data would occur at x+16?. . This is also relevant for getting height and width for images and matrices since we don't have access to mat->width/height or img->width/height.. We do have functions for getting width/height, but here is the problem I see:. If I'm testing Image_init(), I want to check if my width and height are properly initialized. Ok, so I use Image_width() and Image_height() here. But when I want to test Image_width(), I want to use Image_init() with a hardcoded value and see if Image_width() returns the same value.

Why would doing the former be considered to be bad design and not respecting the interface?|78|0|active|We don't want to think about, rely upon, or worry about the implementation details of the `Matrix` struct. This includes the variable name choices used by the struct. Maybe for some reason, the implementer of the matrix struct wants to change the name of the `int width;` variable to `int mat_width;` or something like that. It doesn't really matter what it is, because the person who designed `Matrix` and its interface declared that if you want to get the width of the matrix, you shalt use the `Matrix_width()` function, and so we need to respect that. We can't rely on the `mat->width` variable existing at all. This designation is important because it gives the person who implements the `struct Matrix` the freedom to change/remove `int width` if they need/want to, while simultaneously restricting them so that the function `Matrix_width()` always has the same name and always performs the same task.. . In summary, we need to respect interfaces because they are an agreement between the user of the struct and the implementer of the struct on which things will remain the same, and which things are subject to change. If we didn't have such an agreement, any changes to the struct implementation might break the users code, which is a big pain. If we don't follow the agreement, then we risk our own code breaking or becoming buggy for a mysterious reason when we update to a new version of the struct.||0

From the spec, regarding the Image module:. . ""The Interface for Image makes it seem like we have a grid of Pixels, but the Image struct actually stores the information for the image in three separate Matrix structs, one for each of the RGB color channels. There are no Pixels in the underlying representation, so your Image_get_pixel function must pack the RGB values from each color Matrix into a Pixel to be returned. Likewise, Image_set_pixel must unpack RGB values from an input Pixel and store them into each Matrix.. Each of the functions in the Image module takes a pointer to the Image that is supposed to be operated on. When you are writing implementations for these functions, you may be tempted to access members of the Matrix struct directly (e.g. img->red_channel.width, img->green_channel.data[x]). Don’t do it! They aren’t part of the interface for Matrix, and you should not use them from the outside. Instead, use the Matrix functions that are part of the interface (e.g. Matrix_width(&img->red_channel), Matrix_at(&img->green_channel, r, c)).. In your implementation of the Image_init functions, space for the Matrix members will have already been allocated as part of the Image. However, you still need to initialize these with a call to Matrix_init to ensure they are the right size!. The Image struct contains width and height members. These are technically redundant, since each of the Matrix members also keeps track of a width and height, but having them around should make the implementations for your functions easier to read."""|220|0|active|An RGB pixel has three components to it (red, green, blue).

I'm working on these functions but I am trying to understand why I can't just ceil() or just add one I know we also can't static cast to a double but I don't really know what other approach to take now. . . |7|0|private|I would say your approach to these functions is great, especially Matrix_row.  Matrix_column will not differ much from the Matrix_row implementation.. .  1   1   1.  1   1   1.  1  [1]  1. . Ex. your index is 7 from your pointer arithmetic, and youre currently in the 1st column (according to the picture above).  We also know the size of the width and the height (they are both 3 in this example).  to get from 7 --> 1, we can do 7 - 3 - 3.

kz025zgcih65lm|test cases with const Matrix* max|I am trying to write test cases for functions that take in a const Matrix* mat as a parameter but I'm unsure how to actually initialize a Matrix that is const. Normally I would create a matrix, call Matrix_init() and then call *Matrix_at() to add values into it. But now I can't do that since it's const so how do I fill the Matrix in order to preform tests? |150|1|active|It should still work if you initialize and fill your `Matrix` as non-const and call `Matrix_max` with it.

kyzvevjfzpb4c5|Matrix cout|When I was running my test cases after initializing a matrix, the matrix was not being printed out correctly, and I was wondering why that was the case because it was affecting my other functions.. . My test case is as follow: . TEST(Matrix_at) {.     Matrix *mat1 = new Matrix;.     Matrix *mat = new Matrix;.     *mat1 = {1,2,3,4,5,6};.     const int width = 3;.     const int height = 2;.     for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {.         cout << (*mat1).data[i];.     }. .

And I've also tried creating a new variable for (*mat1).data[i] and couting that as well as putting extra parentheses around (*mat1).data[i].|9|0|private|You can't initialize a Matrix like you did on the 3rd line of your test case. When you dereference mat, you access the entire struct (not just the array representation of the Matrix). The only way to insert values into the Matrix and not break the interface is by using Matrix_at, Matrix_fill, or Matrix_fill_border. Additionally, you must initialize a Matrix with Matrix_init before calling these functions. For example, you could call Matrix_init(mat, 3, 2), and then loop through the rows/cols of the Matrix and set values with Matrix_at.||0
kyzs9nod3e46fs|matrix tests|Hello,. . I am still having the same issue as in @1374. I went to office hours and added specific cases as suggested then autograder took one point off my tests. I am quite stuck in this problem. Would it be possible for you to take a look at my code? ( I added my unique name to the personal projects section on my profile-didn't know how else to do that : )) Thank you a lot in advance for your time and help! |152|0|active|"@6 contains instructions on how to add your uniquename. . While it is possible for us to look at your code, I'm not sure it would be a very illuminating or useful experience for either of us. Particularly, we don't actually know what all the bugs are that you need to catch on the autograder (this is going to be the case outside of 280 as well! Whether in a job or different class, etc.). So we as staff would perform the exact same steps as you are right now, sitting down and thinking about edge cases and interesting test inputs for each function, then testing those cases/inputs. There is truly nothing else we can do other than provide general testing guidance, as the alternative is basically us telling you how to write your project. . . Testing is hard, and it's hard to know when you have tested enough. This is simply an annoying truth about testing, and all students (staff included) learn this the hard way throughout EECS courses here. I know it's not fun (I much dislike testing myself), and I know it's hard, but it's a part of writing C/C++ code that you can't avoid. . . My general approach to testing in EECS courses includes a first pass of testing where I think through each function and make tests for all the edge cases/interesting inputs that come to mind. Then I usually discover that this wasn't enough because I didn't spend enough time really thinking about the edge cases involved, so I go and do a second pass where I spend more time thinking about what inputs I can give that are strange (these are all just different ideas/words for edge cases). During this second pass, I'll probably **spend more time on the difficult functions**, for example the `Matrix_min_value_in_row` function is more complex than `Matrix_at`, so I will spend more time thinking about/testing the former. Then if still more testing needs to be done, and I've *truly* exhausted all edge cases that I can think of (it's hard to think of *every* single edge case, but make sure to try for a while first), then you can try writing ""stress tests"" where you throw a large amount of input/operations into the test case in the hopes that you get lucky. . . I know this post doesn't directly answer your original question, but I hope it gives you some insights on why it's totally ok and normal to be stuck on testing with only a small number of points left to obtain. I also hope it gives you some inspiration to go back and think more about edge cases, focus your efforts on the complex functions, and write more tests!"||1

kywfksmhmow1yz|Matrix_row and Matrix_column|How would I  do Matrix_columb and Matrix_row without using loops? The only way I can think of finding the row or column of a pointer value is by dereferencing the pointer and then looping through the matrix to see what values are equal to the value of the dereferenced pointer.|253|0|active|Think about using math in order to solve this problem. Because of array decay, mat->data is going to give us the pointer to the first element in the data array. Since we have pointer to the first element and the element we want, we can subtract the pointers to find out how many elements are in between them (aka the index of the wanted element). This is because array elements are stored contiguously in memory. We can use this information and other properties of the matrix (width and/or height) to then find the row. I suggest writing out the matrix to help you see it visually!||2

For functions that ask for finding the removable seam, we know that it modifies the seam[] array.. . We can use this to our advantage. After creating a cost matrix in a test case and calling the find removable seam function, we can check that each element in the seam array is what know it should be (since we created and know what the cost matrix is).. . You can apply a similar strategy to the remove seam functions though it is a bit more tedious. Assuming all other functions are tested and working, the remove seam functions are tested when you run resize.cpp using the same files they provide for you (example dog.ppm).||1

As long as your other functions don't use the actual length of seam[] (which I think should be impossible, since we don't pass the size of seam as an argument in any of the functions), everything else should work out fine.

kytn43cpnnv78o|Question|Hi, . . I have a question: Why do we need to put the spaces, rather here on lines 160, 161, 162, 163? . .

The difference in both the images is giving the spaces in the beginning, and the end of the curly brackets, why is this the case here? I'm asking this because what I'm seeing here is that autograder marks that the code is incorrect in terms of logic because of this reason. May I know why this is the case?|17|0|private|I don't think that the whitespaces at the beginning and end of the curly brackets would give you an error on the autograder.

Also, when trying to run Matrix_tests, I received this sanitizer error. What does it mean?|190|0|active|I think I had misunderstood your question previously. You must initialize your matrix properly in your test cases before calling Matrix_print(). If you don't, and have just allocated space for it, the matrix's values could be undefined. Thus, it's important to allocate space for it and call Matrix_init() to initialize it before working with it.. . As far as the memory errors, if your tests don't clean up the memory they allocated for the matrix before the test ends, you'll get an error. If your implementation exits early because of some error and therefore doesn't get to the part that cleans up the memory, you'll get an error too. Assuming that you call delete on the matrix pointer before the test ends, you should be fine if your implementation is correct and doesn't exit the test early.||1

The issue here is that we are trying to perform an operation on an Image that changes its size, despite the fact that the Image object has no functionality in its interface to change the size of an Image that has already been created.. . If the Image class was designed with a method that crops the image and discards the rightmost column, then the operation would be trivial to do in-place, by simply erasing the desired pixel in each row, shifting the remainder of the row over, and then calling the crop operation to reduce the size of the image.. . In this project, however, we settle for a simpler implementation where we simply construct a new Image with the output size and then copy over everything except the pixels we want to erase.. .

This, however, is the perfect use case for running your code on CAEN before you submit. Because CAEN's environment matches the autograder exactly, it is a great tool for sanity checking your code and ensuring you don't waste submits on compile errors (especially if you are closing in on project deadlines). The important takeaway is that you shouldn't use the autograder for debugging. . According to your last submit, you have a bunch of syntax errors..

When we're trying to read in the width and height from the input stream, do we have to find a way to skip the P3 value so we don't store it as our width or height? If so, would I have to read in is on separate lines for each value? Or can I do it as I've shown in my code below? . . . . . Additionally, I understand we have to initialize all three color-channel matrices using the Matrix_innit function. However, I don't understand at all how to read in the RGB values from the PPM file.

I used cout and failed the public test. |276|0|active|os is an ofstream. You check this out in the lecture notes, we will also be covering this in lecture on Monday. . Basically, you can treat your ofstream just like you do cout.. . The difference is that when you call the function Matrix_print, the os parameter can take in arguments like cout, but it can also take in arguments for files to output to, so your result would just output to the file rather than the terminal. ||1

kyq41dtsiw53qr|Error|When writing my functions I get an error that says invalid operands to binary expression ('int const [250000] and const int?  What does this mean? Why is it appearing?. |96|0|active|It seems like you’re getting that error because you’re trying to use some binary operator (which is an operator that takes two arguments, like + or -) on an array and an integer. However, binary operators expect two arguments of the same type, which is why you’re getting the compiler error. I’m guessing you want to compare two integers, in which case you’d most likely want to index into the array to get some value. ||1
kyq1v2efsxvma|How can I test only a few functions?|I want to test only a few of the Matrix functions that I have written so far, but I can not figure out how to do so using the public tests provided. The public test setup is much different from last project, where I could just comment out the tests I did not want to run, so I am confused as to how to go about testing.|133|0|active|You could technically comment out certain lines of the public test, but this is not ideal.. . This is why its very helpful to write your own tests in Matrix_tests.cpp before implementing functions. Like let's say you wanted to sit down and write Matrix_init, Matrix_width, and Matrix_height. You could write a test that just uses those functions first, write the functions, then run your test.||0
kypyzo38s9f24z|Size of Matrix|"In the spec, under ""The Matrix Module (Matrix.h),"" it says ""dimensions of 0 are not allowed."" However, in the ""Implementing Matrix (Matrix.cpp)"" section, the requires clause says that row, column can be =0 (the must be >=0). If 0 dimensions are not allowed, but the requires clause allows it, what should we do if the dimensions are 0?"|153|0|active|This is for the Matrix_at function, which takes in a row and column index to get the pointer to. The first row of the Matrix is index “0”. This is similar to how arrays start at 0.So for example if you have a 1 by 1 matrix, it only has one element, which is at row 0 column 0.Dimensions of 0 are not allowed, but row and column indicies of 0 are fine because they simply represent first row and first column respectively.||0
kypeemdap9i2dv|When using const int ptr I get an invalid operands with binary expression error?|Why would I receive this error?  I thought you cun use ptr?|130|1|active|You are not allowed to divide a pointer by a number.

kypafasnt4i459|What does const int* ptr do? is it an address number pointed to in matrix? and index vs matrix?|I guess it is a pointer to an int.  So does that mean that it is the address of one of the numbers listed in the matrix?. . When a function takes const int* ptr in, is that an address it is taking in that points to an element of the function?. . Would the input be in the format of an address like 0x2018 or an integer like 5?  . . Also, why is it constant?  Does it always point to the same element in all functions it is used for?. . The spec also mentions that Your Matrix_at functions will need to perform the appropriate arithmetic to convert from a (row,column) pair to an index in the array, and your Matrix_row and Matrix_column functions will need to go in the other direction.  I thought the index of an array would be a (row, col) so I am confused on how these are different?|266|2|active|A bit confused about what the question is, but will try my best:. . const int* ptr is a pointer to a constant integer. This means that the pointer itself can be modified (you can change where it points to) but the object it points to cannot be modified. See more about this distinction at @1076. . I think you are talking about the function const int* Matrix_at(const Matrix* mat, int row, int column). In this case, the function should return a pointer to a constant integer, which is the integer at row row and column column in the matrix. This function is useful for when you want to read a value from the read-only Matrix (if the Matrix itself is const) and do not want to change it.. . The value returned from Matrix_at is a pointer, so you need to dereference it with *ptr to get the actual value of the integer it points to.. . For your last question, think about how the Matrix struct is implemented. The int data[MAX_MATRIX_WIDTH * MAX_MATRIX_HEIGHT] where you are storing the numbers is 1D. The pointer to the first element is data, the second is data+1, etc. When we work with Matrices, we like to instead think of them as being 2D with rows and columns. So we make the function Matrix_at, which allows us to convert a row and column into a pointer to the actual data internally stored in the struct's array. Likewise, Matrix_row and Matrix_col allow us to figure out what row and column a pointer to a piece of data in the struct's array corresponds to.. . Think of the array in the struct as the internal storage, and the Matrix functions as a nice way to talk with that data. You need to implement those functions so that they do this. ||0

However I just get the actual values of the elements, not its index.. . edit: solved. I found out that my test case was incorrect. I was pointing to another array rather than mat->data, thats how the addresses didn't line up.|143|0|active|You are close. Lets say we have an array Arr that contains [1 2 3 4 5]. The address of 4 minus the address of 1 will be 3. So if we have a pointer at the number 4, we can subtract the address of the first element of our array to obtain 4s index which is 3.

Maybe this code snippet will help you think about how to modify data: . ```. int x = 5. int* y = &x. ```. If you can only access the pointer `y` , how would you change the value of `x`? There's an operator that we learned that works on pointers to get to the original value of `x`, and that will help solve your problem of modifying `data`. ||1

kynlomzu2aj3ah|Use new Matrix or new Matrix()|I know the difference between `Matrix *ptr1 = new Matrix` and `Matrix *ptr2 = new Matrix()` is that the second one use `()`, **zero initialization**, which initializes every element in the `strcut` to default value(`0`). But the first one uses **default initialization**, which keeps all members in `struct` uninitialized(random). . . However, in the starter files, instructors use the first way to initialize variables. Is there a reason for using the first method? Either in the perspective of performance or the viewpoint of functionality?. . . (I know there is a third way to solve the confusion between constructor and zero initialization, `Matrix *ptr3 = new Matrix{}`. But I think we dont need to consider this one right now.)|175|0|active|I believe the first two you stated (new Matrixand new Matrix()) are both examples of default initialization. new Matrix; is an example of implicit default initialization. This happens when you don't include a constructor, so one will implicitly be formed for you. It will initialize the object and any of its member variables (width and height in this case). For new Matrix(), this would also be an example of default initialization, except you could choose to set some of the member variables as they do in this snippet from the notes:. . . public:.   // default constructor.   Triangle().     : a(1), b(1), c(1) {}. . As for the project, my guess is we chose the implicit one as you will be working with these variables during the project, and we don't want to confuse anyone by setting them to specific values. From a performance standpoint, I don't believe there would be much difference between using the implicit or creating a default constructor in this specific case since we're working with ints. Maybe if our member variables were some super large data types it could be different, but anybody else feel free to put their own thoughts. Good luck with the project!||2

Because we heavily rely on certain functions to test our other member functions.. . ![Screen_Shot_2022-01-20_at_14.17.37.png](/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&prefix=paste%2Fke97zxvroac2cg%2F6051494583923216ab7cc54753fa105608e8e6c2fd67b0fbad83fa9e535661df%2FScreen_Shot_2022-01-20_at_14.17.37.png)|412|1|active|I believe the main reason we enforce respecting the interface in your tests is because we take the view that these tests should be testing the *behavior* of the Matrix functions through its public interface rather than testing the particular implementation (where using the implementation details in your test to verify the public interface behavior boils down to testing the implementation).. . There is definitely debate about this when it comes to unit testing though, some points are:. * Testing implementation should be done in order to test all code paths (the thinking is that only testing the public interface isn't enough to get complete coverage, and untested code is dangerous). * Testing implementation should be done since (as you mentioned) unit tests should only test one thing at a time, but our functions can use the public interface in its implementation, so we end up failing potentially our entire test suite despite one bug (so number of failures doesn't reflect number of bugs). * Testing implementation shouldn't be done because changing the implementation could entirely break your unit tests, and what you really care about is that the code behaves according to the desired spec set out by its public interface. . Ultimately for this class, you're doing whitebox testing, which means you have access to the implementation of the public interface that you're writing test cases for, so you can actually test all (or most) of the code paths in your implementation just using the interface. It does mean that all unit tests don't necessarily test one thing (but you should still strive to do that as much as possible). You'll just have to make the assumption in your test cases that the rest of the public interface is bug-free and available to use in testing (even if it might not be the case) and recognize if that test fails, you may need to look at the test cases for the other public interface methods you're using to make sure its behaving appropriately. Hope that helps!. . ||2

Those grade the actual code you write and is the same as in P1.. . What you are referring to are your test cases. Unlike P1, test cases are graded in P2. You need to expose 10 bugs with your matrix tests, and 11 with your image tests. Write a lot of tests with edge cases.||0

kyn0ombidkw2ly|Project 2|Is it just me or does Project 2 look pretty daunting? Lol|344|4|active|P2 definitely is very very daunting especially at this point in the semester, but don't worry! We'll cover a lot of the concepts that are needed for P2 in lecture. If you're planning on getting started in the next few days, my recommendation is take a look through the spec and understand what each function is trying to implement. Don't worry if you're not too sure about how some of the code organization works; we'll be talking about `struct`s and `class`es in lecture next week.. . You're not behind if you don't choose to start the project as soon as it comes out though. For a lot of EECS courses, the projects are really hard to start until the relevant concepts have been covered in lecture; don't feel pressured to rush out the project by any means. (That said, still try to start relatively early, but you don't have to start the day the project comes out) You got this! Best of luck!||0
kymh81oyr4dp|Project 2 FAQ|"Refer to this post for Frequently Asked Questions regarding Project 2. Project 2 is due Friday, February 4 at 8pm.  Please keep the followups related to questions in this post only.. . Spec is here.  Introduction slides for this project are here.  Find partners to work with via @5. . Resize GUI repository (you can use this to easily try your resize code on other images!): https://github.com/oalejel/resize-GUI. Write clear code! This is especially important for this project, remember:Matrix width = # of columnsMatrix height = # of rowsInstead of using variables like ""i"" and ""j"" in your for-loops, consider using ""row"" and ""col"" so you don't get confused!Q: Am I required to use traversal by pointer?A: No. You are allowed to, but not required to use traversal by pointer in this project. You should choose to traverse by index/pointer based on what makes sense to you logically.Q: My program takes a couple minutes or more to run. Is this expected? A: Yes, but not too long - your program should run in under 30 seconds. Double check that you're not looping unnecessarily or calling an inefficient function within a loop. Perf is also a helpful tool for improving efficiency! https://eecs280staff.github.io/p2-cv/#appendix-b-perf-tutorialQ: Rotate left is failing, even though it was provided. Is there an error in the provided function? A: Rotate left calls several student implemented image functions, which can cause errors in rotate left.Q: Why do I have to write functions like Matrix_width? Couldn't I just use matrix->width directly?A: Unless you're implementing a Matrix function, this is generally considered really poor design! We actually consider this incorrect behavior, even if you get the right results, so please make sure you use the right function. Even if it's just Matrix_width and Matrix_height, whenever you're not writing Matrix functions, go through the interface - the same goes for Image as well.Q: Do I have to respect the interface when writing tests?A: Yes, tests should always respect the interface! In the real world, this means you can reuse tests when changing the implementation to make sure that you haven't also changed the interface, such that you can avoid updating the code everywhere the interface is used!Q: How can I test Matrix_at without breaking the interface?A: When thinking of unit testing, you should think in units as behavior instead of units as functions, because it is common to have functions like Matrix_at that solely rely on the underlying implementation. When testing Matrix_at, we really want to test the behavior of setting and retrieving independent values reliably from our matrix. For example, you could test that setting a value at (0,1) doesn't modify the value at (1,0) or other similar variations of this.Q: What does it mean for the column start to be inclusive and the column end to be exclusive? A: This means that when looking for the min value, you should consider the column start but not column end. For example, if my column start was 2 and my column end was 5, I would consider columns 2,3, and 4, but not 5. Q: Why am I failing crabster but passing dog and horses?A: Crabster tends to catch more edge cases. Be sure that in all cases you're checking the correct columns when you compute the energy, cost, and seam.. Q: One of my processing test is failing, but when I print out the output it matches the correct file. A: Double check your image init. If you read in the correct image incorrectly, then Image_equal will fail even if you've processed the image correctly.. . Q: I am missing some test cases. What other tests should I write to catch the test cases?. A: Sorry! We don't share what test cases the AG is looking for. The best advice we can give it to brainstorm more edge cases. . . Q: I'm trying to run processing_public_test.cpp/resize.cpp on XCode, and Xcode is saying that it's unable to open dog.ppm/crabster.ppm/horses.ppm.. A: You need to update XCode's custom working directory: https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_xcode.html#run. Happy coding!. process#unping.exe"|885|1|active|||0
