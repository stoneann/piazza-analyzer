Make sure to close that before trying to commit. . . In worst case scenario if you can't get it working from within there, you can pull down your repository in another directory, copy the changed files over, and then commit from there. If you've messed up anything with the git configuration in that original repository, pulling down somewhere else should avoid that.||0

ktuoffgbfq11dl|Project 1 Help|Hi, . My name is Seta and I am in your EECS 280 class. . I checked my grade this morning for Project 1 and I was a little surprised that I had failed so many of the private tests, as I thought I was pretty thorough in my testing in my work on this project. In an effort to learn from my mistakes and be able to improve on the next project, I went to office hours today and met with a GSI. When she looked at my code in the Autograder, she actually told me that she herself didn't understand why I was graded so low and she couldn't identify more than one issue that would have had me fail so many of the cases, and said that I had accounted for almost all edge cases in my testing Clearly, I'm missing something, but for the sake of learning and trying not to make the same mistakes for the next project, could you please find time to go over with me what I did wrong on this project / how to improve my test case writing? Let me know when you are available, or if someone could look at it over email / office hours. . . Thank you very much, . Seta Hagopian |10|0|private|I took a look at your AG submission.  Here's what I found:. . For median:  Looks like you're not 0-indexing.  Recall vectors are 0-indexed.. For mode:  Consider the case {2, 2, 3, 3, 3}.  Your code doesn't the case if the mode is the greatest value in the vector by just one greater frequency.. . For percentile:  Based on Appendix A of the percentile formula, v must be sorted for the formula to work.  You cannot assume that v is sorted when it is passed in and you don't sort v in the function.. . For summarize:  Your function looks to operate based on the assumption that v is sorted.  Unfortunately there is no requirement for v to be sorted for the function and you don't sort your vector in the function implementation.. . For count: There is no requirement that v isn't empty, i.e. your assert statement will fail if v is empty.. . For testing in the future, I recommend fully taking a look at the RME of the functions you're implementing and testing cases that almost break your requires clause, i.e. test cases that fulfill your requires clause but barely fulfill it.  Also make sure to not make assumptions on the arguments of your function beyond what's stated in the requires clause.  If you wish to discuss testing strategies or project strategies with someone, I recommend going to proffice hours this week if you have the time (or the normal OH queue if you unable to attend any of the proffice hour times).  The professors have been teaching this class for many semesters and have a lot of advice for how to write good test cases and how to approach the future projects.  Hope this helps.||0

ktrrsy1a5dl50b|Project 1, main valgrind|for my valgrind I am getting back this error and I'm not sure what it means |18|0|private|"In order to read this error, we can do the following:. Look at what the specific error is, in this case ""Invalid read of size 8"". This means we have a container storing objects that are each 8 bytes (in this case doubles), and we are reading memory that we cannot access (accessing the container out of bounds).Look at the line below. This tells us the function it is happening in (percentile) and the file/line number where the error occurs (stats.cpp::124).. . I would also recommend taking a look at the recorded debugging session to learn more about reading valgrind errors. But, a potential issue was mentioned by another instructor in the followups. "||1

ktrmxde5y576mo|Project 1 Final Grade|. Hello,. I had a question about how grading worked for the project. I received a score of 16/18 on the project and it seems to be due to valgrind errors. My final grade seems to be coming from a submission I made on September 12th. However, I had fixed my valgrind errors in a later submission (my final submission being on september 15th. I was not sure why my final grade did not come from my final submission. I was wondering if this was an error or if my grade was worse on my later submission. Any insight would be beneficial!.

ktotrphe2zl4i4|problem&#xff1a;Test real data|I test my code by stats_test.cpp , main_test_data.tsv and other special conditions. They all work. But when I test the real data, it just like stopping at summarize but without any bug or errors. What should I do?|118|2|active|I suspect there isn't really an error but rather your program is taking a long time to run, i.e. if you let your code run and come back in an hour or two then it'll probably finish.  Based on follow ups it sounds like you are using a double loop in summarize which is probably what is causing this timing issue.  With the real data set, the data vector is very large (VERY large) so you're summarize function runs in $$O(n^2)$$ which isn't ideal for large data sets.. . That being said, for 280, we don't expect your code to run in under 30 seconds for a data set of size 4002 in this project (We leave writing super time efficient programs for eecs 281).  So rest assured we won't run your code on a data set that large on the AG for this project.  For future projects, we will specify in the spec if we plan on running your code with large data sets and tips/tricks for if your code is taking too long.||2

ktot11oebjl15l|Summarize Output|Hello! I am having some trouble with my summarize function. When I test main_test_data.tsv on my terminal, it only outputs . 6: 1 . 7: 1. 8: 1. 10: 1. I'm not sure why it skips 9: 1 entirely. I tried setting breakpoints, writing more tests, and stepping into my code but I still can't catch the bug. |7|0|private|I think the part that is causing this is your if statement if (i == v.size() - 1). When you reach i = 4, Element = 9 and frequency = 1.. Because i = 4 and v.size() = 5, you enter that if statement and then you enter the else statement that pushes back v.at(i), so you never push 9 back into the vector.||0

How would I get that last vector of values to appear?|109|0|active|Think about what happens when you reach the last value in your vector. You never hit a statement that adds this to the vector because you never run into the case that adds the value if it does not equal the previous/next value - you simply run out of items and the loop exits. However, this value along with its frequency should still be saved in whatever variables you are saving them in.

Since 1 is an int and x is an int, then your compiler will evaluate 1/x to be an int.  In your case, nan if x = 0 (divide by zero), 1 if x = 1, and 0 if x > 1.  I'm guessing that when you are running your code, v is a non empty vector that has more than one element.  So then 1/x will evaluate to 0 and then var = 0 - 1=  -1 .  Later on, it looks to be that when assigning a value to 'stand', you end up with a negative under the sqrt.. . To have 1/x specifically be evaluated to a double, then try doing 1.0/x.  Adding the '.0' will tell the compiler to evaluate 1.0/x into a double.||0

I understand what the function is supposed to do, but I have been having trouble with the loops. The approach I tried was to do a for loop that checks to see if the currently indexed value in the vector is the same as the last, and if it is, increase a counter variable, and if not, it moves on to an else if statement that adds the current value and its frequency to a random filler vector of vectors. My problem was that with my approach of checking index of v[i] and v[i+1] in the for loop, its trying to check outside of the array. My solution that was offered in office hours was to keep the for loop as it was and to add an additional check after the loop to see if the last element was the same as the one before it or not.

In particular, even though sumv is initialized to be empty, remember that sumv is a vector of vectors, so you need to initialize the outer vector (which you do on line 16) and the inner vectors as well. The inner vectors should be initialized before you add them to sumv, so is there a line where you push back a vector to sumv? I would check that line to make sure that when you add a vector to sumv, all of its elements are initialized. ||0

This only started happening after I added a negative number to the vector, but it was not added to the total at this point.|92|1|active|This is OK. Doubles in c++ can experience rounding errors, so even though you are expecting 75.37, you end up with some high precision error. As a result, when we compare doubles we can't use the == operator.

If you have a `vector> w`, you can use vector methods on `w` to modify the outer vector (e.g. `w.push_back({1, 2, 3})`). For the inner vectors, you must use the vector element access methods (such as `w[idx]` or `w.at(idx)`) to get a specific element, and then you can likewise use the vector methods to modify those (e.g. `w.at(0).push_back(5)`).||1

If so, does that mean count, sum, etc. will all be 0?|15|0|private|Great thinking! The constraints of the inputs and outputs are more clearly labeled as REQUIRES and EFFECTS respectively in the comments of each of the functions in stats.h  provided in the starter files. To answer your question directly though, you will need to account for an empty vector for count(). Most of the other functions require that the input vector is not empty, in which case you will not need to. You could always use assert() to verify the inputs of the functions follow the constraints of the requires clause which is considered good practice but not required.||1

Though the output looks a bit scary, this is actually the AddressSanitizer doing it's job by providing extra information about what caused the crash. If the output scares you, you can always edit your Makefile to remove the AddressSanitizer references that you added during the setup tutorial. The most important thing to look at here are the first couple lines, representing the order of functions that were called to lead to the crash. On line 43 of stats_test.cpp, the sum function was called. On line 22 of `stats.cpp` inside that sum function, your program crashed. Those might be locations to look at to find your bug.||0
