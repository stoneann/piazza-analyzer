kvkez7um2n63g6|test cases problem|When running my test cases, for some reason after the block of code is run, after it reaches the end parenthesis of the unit test block, my code always executes the pop_front() function.

kv75kwv91v053a|1-on-1 Office Hours/Exam Advice (project 3 disappointment)|Hi I wanted to reach out to see if any of the instructors offer 1-on-1 office hours and if it would be possible to schedule an appointment soon? I really thought I was doing ok with the course work until project 3 scores were released today (got a 78/137) and while I really just underestimated how many private tests would be dedicated to euchre, I was really surprised to see I missed 2 different private card tests (despite getting all the bugs for card). Totally understand if this is a better professor office hours question, but I wondered if there are helpful strategies that you can suggest for projects? I spent probably about 2-3 hours each day since the project was released working on it (and had a partner) and understandably I just wish my grade reflected the amount of time spent. Does this suggest I need to read the spec more closely, to make sure the functions include edge cases? I'm honestly just feeling really insecure about my coding abilities now and I would love any advice (particularly before the midterm Wednesday). |26|0|private|(Marking as resolved after Jolie and I met in office hours.)||0

kv5eiol117z22g|Project 3 grade question|"Hello!. . My name is Gillian and my uniquename is jamesgil. I'm asking this question on Piazza because all instructors are on here and I'm not sure who predominantly deals with grading, but my enrolled instructor is Somayeh Molaei. Essentially, I want to ask if there's any way I can get any leniency in my Project 3 grade. I wouldn't normally ask for something like this, but I figured asking can't hurt, and I completely understand if 'no' is the flat answer.. . Basically, I'm feeling a bit screwed over by my partner for project 3 (uniquename jqnewman). We met in the first week after the project spec was posted and stubbed functions together, and throughout the project after that they were very unreliable. They seemed to have no availability to work on the project and took no initiative in the project for the first 2 weeks, and they did not respond to my texts often when asking if they could work on the project or if they could meet up. I proceeded to essentially write the entirety of Card.cpp, Card_Tests.cpp, Pack.cpp, Player.cpp, Player_tests.cpp on my own. The only thing my partner helped with was the shuffle() function in pack (which they wrote an implementation for, but it was not tested and did not work, so I had to finish writing it and testing it anyways), and they pasted the player_factory() outline from the project spec into player.cpp. They told me they would ""pull their weight"" during the final week of the project, and I had exams during the first part of that week so I chose to rely on her to begin the driver function. They were adament that working virtually worked better for them, so we did not meet in person. They did not start working until Thursday night, while I was finishing up player_tests.cpp, and then proceeded to tell me they finished writing the entire driver function! I thought, great, its at least close to done! However, when we tried to finalize things on Friday, our euchre.cpp was SO full of bugs and irregular behavior, and also did not account for a lot of the edge cases, so of course it was failing the tests. It took us all our time together Friday (which was limited because we both had classes, and she had IA office hours from 6:30 to 8) just to get the driver to compile, and by then we did not have enough time to fully debug before turning the project in. Also, all our style points were lost to euchre.cpp (which you can see in the autograder), which was, for lack of a better phrase, coded like an absolute mess. . . Basically, I'm frustrated because i put a lot of work into carefully coding and testing all the helper function files, and it feels like a lot of that work has been lost because our driver function is an absolute mess, and one that I did not have enough time or notice to work through. Further, all the points in our final autograder submission were achieved from the files that I implemented, essentially by myself (Card.cpp, Card_tests.cpp, Player.cpp, Player_tests.cpp, Pack.cpp). Its generally disappointing because I was really looking forward to successfully coding a working euchre.cpp file, and I feel like the lack of planning, communication, and, imbalance of work on my partner's end prevented us from doing this. Arguably, I could have taken further initiative earlier on in the project and set us up for more success, but this was difficult to do when I felt bad for 'overtaking' the project, doing more than my fair share of work, and doing more work without her affirmation or thoughts (since getting a response from her was very difficult).  . . Without a doubt, I think its valid to assert that this poor project grade is a reflection of both my partner and I's lack of organization, but I can't help but feel that this lack of organization was very one-sided, and made it exceptionally more difficult for me to maintain an agenda that would lead to success. (ie, if I had done the project by myself, I could have made myself a schedule and followed it without being limited by another person's lack of organization and reliability). Regardless, I want to emphasize that I understand if there's absolutely no changes to my project grade that can be made, but I figured I would at least explain my situation, and see if there's any possible resolution. Thank you (and I'm sorry to make you read such a long piazza post)! Please let me know if there's anyone I can reach out to directly about this issue! "|37|0|private|Dear Gillian,.

kv4dzkqs3q06u9|Project 3 Extension|Good evening,. . I hope this email reaches you well. My name is Aya Assaf and I wanted to inform you of my current circumstances regarding Project 3. I began working on Project 3 in the first week that it was assigned. I have nearly everything done but there's a bug that I haven't been able to address. I wanted to ask for an extension because even though there is such little left to do, my mental health has been significantly deteriorating in these past few weeks. I had to go to the doctors because of the physical impacts my stress has been having on my health. My anxiety is also making it extraordinarily hard to function and I just need a little more time to finish this assignment. . I reached out to Professor Juett yesterday and I didn't get a response yet but I also wanted to reach out to you to inform you of my situation and ask for an extension again. I know this is a late notice but I thought I would be able to finish on time because all my CPP files were passing except for one. I would appreciate it if I could get just a few more days to work on this assignment. Please let me know if that is possible, I would be really grateful if my current situation was taken into consideration.. . Thank you,.

kv47zfr5r771jw|bad access|i am getting a bad access error when i am going through the euchre01 test. it is happening on the third hand on the second person who wants to pass and i'm confused because it worked for hand 1 and 2 and at the start of 3. I don't know where to go to figure out whats wrong. any advice would be appreciated!. . |9|0|private|Based on this snippet, the dangerous part seems like `players[dealer_index + i]`, where players is probably an array/vector of size 4, dealer_index is the index in that array of the current dealer, and i is some for-loop variable to go across the next four players. This seems dangerous because we may not be checking whether dealer_index + i is a valid index into our players array - consider when dealer_index = 2 (so player 3 is now dealing), if i = 0, 1, 2, 3 then dealer_index + i = 2, 3, 4, 5 which mean we would be accessing invalid indices of our players array (4 and 5).. . To fix this, consider using the modulo operator - recall that it gives you the remainder when dividing two numbers. For example, 7 % 4 = 3. The nice part about modulo is that it's often used to make sure a number fits into a certain range. Say we had numbers 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ..., if we did % 4 on each of them, then we get 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 0 ... - notice that now all numbers are between 0 and 3. So, its sort of lets us loop back around when a number gets too big for our range ||0

I still failed the euchre.cpp public tests in the autograder for two reasons:. . 1) I didn't skip a line after printing the winners of the game. I did this because I was following the spec meticulously as we are told to do. For example, the spec is very detailed in telling us when to print new lines: ""If a march occurs, print march! followed by a newline."", and ""Print an extra newline when making, adding, and discarding is complete."" However, the instructions to print the winners are simply ""When the game is over, print the winners of the game.""

If 1) is the case, the compiler will look inside player.cpp to find that function, but it's not there.. If 2) is the case, the compiler will look inside that object's class definition, and it's not there.. . In order to solve this, just access the original helper function that you wrote in player.cpp through a player pointer, if that is what you intend; doing something with your players in euchre.cpp.. Moreover, the helper function you're trying to access in player.cpp should be public + not declared as static in order to use it outside player.cpp.||1

kv2r6dknta81nz|Euchre.cpp|Does anyone know what this error can potentially mean? So I declared a Pack variable and then had a void shuffle function that took in that variable.

kv2r2vc3e6e3av|Where should I print out a blank line|"Just want to make sure, we should print a blank line after trump is called and after the prompt for human player when discarding a card right?. By the way, does ""wrong blank lines"" affect the final grading? I have passed all the public tests but it seems that I have misses one or two blank lines."|69|0|active|Sorry we’re only just getting to your question after the project deadline has passed, I know that’s pretty frustrating. To answer your question at least, the new lines do factor into the correctness on the autograder and I believe would affect the final grading, so you should take care to match the sample output given in the starter files as closely as you can. For newlines, that would mean having a blank line after ordering up, between each trick, and after the end of each hand - I may have missed something, but I believe that’s everywhere you would’ve needed a blank line. . edit: nevermind! I forgot about the line in the spec here, which Xianzhi appropriately mentioned in the followups: https://eecs280staff.github.io/p3-euchre/#hints-for-system-testing. ||1

How can we keep track of which player played which card and which team they are on in order to correctly assign points to the right team and also determine the leader of the next trick? Thanks!|50|0|active|Maybe you could create a Player* variable that stores the player who has played the highest card in the trick, and update it as necessary throughout the trick?. . As for keeping track of what team the winning player belongs to, I'm not sure. The solution to that would likely involve computing the correct index of the std::vector that stores your players somehow.||0

kv2qb92wlcl5mx|Running Euchre00- doesn&#39;t get problems until trick 3|I'm really confused on whether the incorrect lines reflect problems with player.cpp (and specifically play_card and lead_card) or with the driver function. I highlighted in red everything that is showing up incorrectly.. |7|0|private|It's kind of tough to say - when players are playing incorrect cards, it really could be a couple different things. Maybe players aren't getting the right cards to begin with, or the player strategy has a bug somewhere like you mentioned, or trump/led suit isn't being stored properly in your driver program - so again, lot of different causes. Using your debugger is probably the best method to figure where exactly things are going wrong, so just stepping through your program until you find the code doing something weird (a value not set right, taking an unexpected branch in your code, etc.). It would be a reasonable guess to start looking at play_card and lead_card though.. . Another option is to write a small test case to simulate the situation at the start of the trick where things are going wrong - for example, give Adi the cards they should have at the beginning of trick 3, then ask them to play a card based on trump and the led suit for that trick. That's another way you can narrow down where the problem could be||0

Everytime I hit a cin statement my debugger just stops.|76|0|active|See this part of the spec for testing human players: https://eecs280staff.github.io/p3-euchre/#hints-for-system-testing. The main idea is that you can run your euchre program with human players using file redirection with euchre_test50.in to simulate a human player entering those commands (rather than having to enter input yourself). The reason your debugger stops at cin statements is because its expecting input, and can't continue until it receives something - if you use file redirection, you can avoid this problem. Otherwise, you would have to open the terminal the debugger is using and input something manually everytime you reach a cin statement||0

If your most recent autograder submission is up to date, its possibly because you've declared the hand member variable as static. Remember that static member variables are variables that are shared across all instances of that class - in other words, the hand being static means every Simple player would share the same hand, when they should each have their own hands.

I tried checking for out of bounds array and vectors and I think I've fixed all of that. But I'm still getting the error. What should I do? At this point, I don't know where I should fix it because I can't debug my code without it printing output. |6|0|private|Hm, so if your euchre program isn't printing anything at all before it segfaults, then its likely segfaulting and ending before the first print statement which narrows things down quite a bit. Meaning, you should check your main program up until the first print statement that gets run in your Game class to see where things are going wrong. You can also use the valgrind output from the autograder to help - one error that might be helpful is this one:. ```. ==60== Process terminating with default action of signal 11 (SIGSEGV): dumping core. ==60==  Access not within mapped region at address 0x0. ==60==    at 0x408455: main (euchre.cpp:378). ```. Notice how the error is in your main function, which supports the idea that something in your program is failing early on before it gets to your Game class. I would check specifically on line 378, where you're accessing the `argv` and `ps` arrays.. . Also, I'm not sure if you have your visual debugger set up, but that's always a good option for debugging if your program isn't printing anything, since you can see what it's actually doing before it fails||0

So how should I make it so that the queen of spades isn't next to the queen of hearts and instead next to the rest of the hearts? Any hints?|5|0|private|If I understand your question right, it seems like you want to sort by suit then rank, rather than the other way around as you currently do when calling sort (so get all the Spades together, then Hearts and so on) - there are two ways you could do this:. 1. Write your own sort function to put the same suit together (not super recommended). 2. Write a custom comparator (something that we'll cover a little later in this course). . Both of these aren't great ideas at the current moment, so maybe the first question we should ask is whether we need cards sorted in an order like this - could you explain more about your situation where you need cards grouped together by suit?

As of right now, I've implemented the Player functions independently in the HumanPlayer and SimplePlayer derived classes, which makes the most sense to me because most of the functions have different implementations depending on if the player is a SimplePlayer or a HumanPlayer.

All the functions require us to do something with the minimum value and the maximum value card in the function. Should this take trump into account. . . For add_and_discard(), trump would be irrelevant, however, shouuld we be factoring trump into consideration for lead_card and play_card. Because technically let's say I had a hand : [9 of Spades, 10 of Hearts, King of Clubs, King of Hearts and Ace of Clubs] with Spades as trump. In this case after sorting, the lowest value would be 9 of spades. However, the 9. of spades in this case is a trump card so we proceed to the next card which would be the 10 of hearts. Would this be the card we should discard? Or does the simpleplayer just act dumb and never take trump into consideration when looking at the value of the cards?. |159|0|active|First of all, for `add_and_discard`, trump is very relevant - the upcard's suit is trump.

kuwx445yuq84se|Game ADT Questions|I have some overall confusion about creating the Game ADT. If I understand correctly all the function stubs (and the implementation if you choose) go within the Game ADT under public. Under private there are certain objects there as well. Is there a good way to think about what is public versus private? . . Also on Player can we create more public (or private?) variables that can be then changed in the GAME ADT? For example (unrelated to the project) if we wanted each player to be known if they are eating during each round we could create within Player bool eating; and then access that through GAME ADT each round and change it to true or false depending on the circumstances. Or is this not allowed? |168|0|active|Members should be public if it makes sense for them to be accessed from outside the Game ADT. For example if you had a member function called play_hand, you'd probably want that to be public so that you could call it outside the Game class. However, you probably want the array of players within the game class to be private, since only the game should have access to those players.. . You are not allowed to modify the definition of Player in the header file, and you also should not explicitly access members of SimplePlayer or HumanPlayer. To use your example, rather than storing whether or not the player is eating within the player itself, the Game could have a separate list of player names or indices to keep track of which players are eating. The Game ADT should hold all the information you need in one place, and you shouldn't have to make any changes to the API of Pack, Card, or Player.||1

The simple player strategy for leading tricks basically boils down to two cases (all trump vs. at least one non-trump) and it looks like you're checking for which case you're in then handling each situation separately, which is a good approach. So, there might just be small things here and there you need to be careful of which you can expose through testing. . The size_t vs int comparison you're running into isn't a terribly big problem - it comes from the .size() method being of type size_t (which is basically an int, but its only positive numbers). You can work with just int variables, and everywhere you run into a size_t (when you call .size()), you can explicitly cast it to an int. . .

(Note: my autograder submission is not quite up to date as I am out of submissions for the day. I plan on submitting again tomorrow morning)"|4|0|private|Hmm, I would take another look at the Simple player round 2 making trump strategy (third paragraph in this section: https://eecs280staff.github.io/p3-euchre/#making). Here's the relevant part:. ```. During round two, a Simple Player considers ordering up the suit with the same color as the upcard, which would make that suit trump. They will order up if that would mean they have one or more trump face cards in their hand (the right and left bowers, and Q, K, A of the order-up suit). ```. . In this case, the upcard suit was Clubs in round 1, however everyone passed so the upcard was flipped over. According to the simple strategy, in round 2 each simple player is now trying to order up the suit of the same color as the old upcard, so they're all trying to order up Spades. Specifically, they'll do so if they have at least 1 face card of that suit - Edsger is to the left of the dealer, so they get first choice. And since they have the Ace of Spades, they order up Spades. Hope that helps!||1

The long answer is that ""ordering up"" a suit is just choosing if you like the suit of the face card based on what's in your hand, and would like that suit to be trump. For your simple player, make_trump should define if your player should or should not like the suit of the face card based on their hand.

In this pdf, the round is just 1,2,3,4, but in my understanding, it can be larger than 4? . . |187|0|active|Dealer: the player who deals out cards from the deck. The person to the left of them always starts when making trump, and the person to the left of them also leads the first trick.. Hand: a hand includes five tricks. It's called a hand because after dealing, each player has a hand of cards, all of which are used during the trick taking process. At the beginning of a hand, the pack is either shuffled or reset, and at the end the tricks are counted and points are scored.. Trick: one trip around the table of playing cards. A trick starts when a player leads a card, and ends when four cards are played and the winner of the trick is determined.. . This is telling you to use modular arithmetic to help keep track of who the dealer is. If the first dealer is player zero, the next is player one, then two, three, etc. The issue is that there is no player four (when counting from zero) because there are only four players in a game of euchre. However, notice that 4%4 == 0. The modulus operator helps you reset the dealer back to player zero after everyone's had a turn dealing.||1

According to the simple player behavior, simple players should only consider the suit that was led, and thusly will either a) play the highest led suit card in their hand or if they have no led suit cards b) play the lowest card in their hand. Following this logic, shouldn't Dabbala play the Nine of Hearts here (considering trump card isn't taken into account)? I don't get why she plays the Queen of Clubs instead.|87|0|active|You're supposed to take the trump card into account. When they say that only the led card is considered, they're not saying that trump is ignored, they're saying that we ignore what the other players have played.||0

kuui1dcqhil1mz|Shuffle Issue with 2 Specific Cards|Hi! When I shuffle a deck created using pack_in, I checked the first round, and everything works; however, by the end of the seventh round, the nine of hearts and ten of diamonds have switched places in the deck. I can see this because when I run my overall Euchre code with test 01, one of the cards in Edsgar's hand is supposed to be the nine of hearts. However, Edsgar instead gets the ten of diamonds, which should not be in play at all (it should be one of the leftover cards). I checked my deal function and I am fairly certain the issue is with shuffling, as the nine of hearts somehow ends up at index 20 of the array and does not get dealt at all.

My question is what should happen in the specific case that the player is the dealer, the upcard is a face card, and the player's hand currently has exactly one trump face card?. .

kutsy55xr236om|Worried about Honor Code Violation|So I woke up this morning and I was going through piazza and saw post @1841. In my code I used card_less to in similar way to find the min and max card in Player.cpp. Seeing that they posted code that uses the same function as I did in a similar style and last week my professor had someone from the honor code office come and talk to us, it made me worried. I'd assume since we all had to write a card_less function in Card.cpp, it would be a common way to find the min or max. But, it still makes me worried seeing similarities in our code and I do not want an honor code violation. Below is 2 spots in my Player.cpp where I find the min and the max card in the hand showing how I implemented card_less.

kuslhphi5pr19b|Shuffle in Pack.cpp| . I'm having trouble writing the shuffle function and I'm not exactly sure where I'm going wrong in the code. What does it mean for std::bad alloc?. . |7|0|private|`std::bad_alloc` means something went wrong with trying to allocate new memory - it's weird that its happening for this test though.. . One observation is that in your inner for-loops, after you set the card into left and right, you do `z += 2`, where z is the index of your middle for-loop. Generally, you want to avoid modifying the loop index inside of the loop since that's usually handled by the for-loop itself (that's the last part in `for (int z = 0; z < PACK_SIZE; ++z)`) and you can end up skipping indices unintentionally. In this case, you'll be updating z by 3 every iteration of the loop - you'd do += 2 inside the loop, then at the end you'll do ++ again because of the loop definition.. . Another thing is that you don't use right or left, so the pack doesn't end up getting shuffled after you call shuffle - somewhere in this function, you need to set the the values of cards.. . For the shuffle logic, I think you're on the right track - I would make sure that you're breaking up the steps properly to perform an in-shuffle. So *first*, get the left and right half of the pack, *then* use those to set each card in pack according to the appropriate index (currently you're getting the left and right half for every index of card, since you have those loops inside the z for-loop).||1
kusjozinee76b0|Help with shuffle|I have submitted my files on autograder so that you can see my code.

I would appreciate any help, thank you. |5|0|private|I think it could be an issue with how you're setting cards from lhs and rhs back into cards. For example:. ```. for(int outer_e = 0; outer_e < 24; outer_e+=2){ .       for(int inner_e = 0; inner_e < 12; ++inner_e){.         cards[outer_e] = rhs[inner_e];  .       }. }. ```. I believe you're trying to set every other index in cards according to the cards in rhs, however the nested loop is problematic. To see that, thing about what happens when outer_e = 0 - we're trying to set the first card in pack equal to the first card in rhs, however we end up running the entire inner for loop for inner_e = 0 all the way up to inner_e = 11, so we really end up setting it to rhs[11], and that happens for all outer_e. To fix this, think about how you might use a single for loop to go through both cards and rhs (same with cards and lhs), using math to make sure the indices work out.. .

If the answer to either of these is a clear ""yes,"" consider making the function a member function.

kuovc1aah242k|Simple Player Playing Tricks|Hi,. . I was comparing my euchre results to the results of euchre_test_01.out.correct while debugging, and I wasn't sure why the correct test results were printing out results the way they did, for Hand 1.. . Here is my thought process:. . 1. For Hand 1, Edsger orders up Diamonds, which means that the trump suit must be Diamonds.. . 2. For the 4th trick, Jack of Hearts is led by Edsger. This means that the led suit of the 4th trick must be Hearts.. . 3. In sum, for the 4th trick of the 1st hand, the trump suit is Diamonds and the led suit is Hearts. . . 4. We know by looking at the results printed in the 4th and 5th trick that at the start of the 4th trick Fran has two cards: Nine of Diamonds, and Ten of Spades. . . 5. At this point, Fran does not have any cards that follow the suit of the lead suit (hearts).. . 6. Therefore, as a simple player, Fran must play the lowest card in their hand.. . 7. The lowest card out of the two Fran has is Ten of Spades. The suit of Nine of Diamonds is equal to the suit of the trump suit, so it must be higher than the card that is not a trump suit.. . 8. Since the lowest card is the Ten of Spades, Fran must play Ten of Spades.. . My code follows my thought process explained above, but the correct test results are different. I was wondering if there was a flaw in my logic.. . Thank you in advance!. .

kulpxhlt1w8v8|Shuffle Procedure|Is there a public video available that shows the shuffling procedure |237|0|active|I have not come across a good video, but here is an explanation that made sense to me.. . . Lay out all the cards in a deck in a line. Split this deck down the middle. We will call this LHS and RHS. Your output card pile is currently empty. The LHS and RHS each are their own pile and you can consider them to have their own indexes. To build your output card pile, add the first card in the RHS, and then the first card in the LHS (index 0). Now there are two cards in your output. Then add the next card in the RHS and then the next card in the LHS (index 1). Now there are 4 cards in your output. Repeat this process until all the cards are in your output pile. This is considered to be 1 in-shuffle.. . . Keep in mind this is a very manual/ brute way of doing the in-shuffle. Think about shortcuts you can make when implementing the algorithm.||2

The same applies to your get_rank_rank function. Also, for those last few errors that say ""control reaches end of non-void function"", just make sure you always return something in those helper functions. So, after your loop just return some int (it doesn't matter what that int is, since ideally your code will never get to that point. ).

C++ doesn't like taking in rvalues by reference (that would imply that you could change these rvalues, which doesn't necessarily make sense since they're temporary.) However, you can take them in by reference-to-const. The explanation is more complicated than this, but I don't personally know all the details. "||1

When the number of these stack frames exceeds this size limit, you get a stack overflow error - this will usually happen if you write a program that makes too many continually nesting function calls.

Why are they outside of the class? and can we implement them in another file?|163|1|active|"Operator functions take 2 inputs, the left-hand side of the operator and the right-hand side of the operator. If the operator was called as part of a class object, you would have to use operator ""on"" the specific class object instance (similar to how you would call a getter or setter like card.get_rank()), which is not possible since a comparison operator expects something on the left and something on the right."||0
kudiuj3qqwo20b|operator functions|Why am I getting this error? Shouldn't the operator functions be expecting only two parameters?. . . |9|0|private|the overloaded operators are not member functions of the Card class.  So when implementing those functions in Card.cpp, get rid of the Card:: in each of those functions.||0
kudfwm0m7i27l1|Comparison Operators|The project spec (https://eecs280staff.github.io/p3-euchre/#value-of-cards) mentions that if 2 cards have the same rank, we should use the suit to break ties, where D > C > H > S. Should our comparison operators (>, <, >=, etc.) in Card.cpp use suit to break ties or should it just compare rank? If it should break ties, isn't < and <= redundant since there are no card duplicates and we'd never compare a card to itself?|11|0|private|"The comparison operators should use suit to break ties in the event that the rank of the cards is the same. To answer your second question, don't think too heavily about the ""when,"" as that understanding will come later in the project as you work through other files. Instead, consider how varies operators can be used together to make the implementation of other operators more simple."||0
kud9mjstpdi2wr|Euchre Project Setup Error|When I downloaded the starter files for Card.cpp and Card.h, some of the existing code had errors that had red squiggles (even after I added in function stubs). . . I tried compiling it after and disabled the error squiggles. Although it compiled, will this error create problems later in the project or is it fine to just ignore them?|149|0|active|Sometimes VScode is a little buggy with these types of declarations.

""a type qualifier is not allowed on a nonmember function"". . This error only seems to go away when I delete the const keyword, but its written to be const in the starter files, so then the compiler doesn't register empty() as being implemented in Pack.cpp.. . Is there something I'm missing?"|178|0|active|Because the compiler has no idea that `empty()` belongs to a class, you have to write `Pack::empty()` to designate it as part of the Pack class.||0

kucwxsh5zgm6pk|In Seek of a Partnership|Hey, my name is Chris and I am a recent transfer student at UMich. EECS 280 is my first ever programming class so learning the syntax of c++ in addition to the complex concepts is a vast task. To supplement this, I've watched hour-long tutorial videos breaking down various topics and attended a multitude of tutoring sessions/ SI sessions (which I continue to do). I was hoping to find a partner who has a bit more experience than me so that we may collaborate and learn from each other while completing the project(s). I am always available so you can always reach out to me to discuss anything regarding the class/ projects. If you're interested in forming a partnership with me, you can DM me on discord (christoogoated#5828) or email (chrisfx@umich.edu) and we can discuss it further.|268|0|active|"Hi Chris,. . I highly recommended you to read the book ""Starting Out with C++"", whose writer is Tony Gaddis. You can read it from Chapter 2. I read it when I am taking my first coding course in my previous institution (I am also a new transfer student, btw). This book is extremely helpful for the beginner. The author is awesome at explaining why the code design this way. From how to define a variable to how to override a function, etc. When I took the first C++ course, I was confused as you, not to mention EECS 280 is at a higher level. I just want to say I used to have the same situation as you, so relax, you can do it!"||1

kubiqrgpjyi1xw|Project 3 FAQ|"Refer to this post for Frequently Asked Questions regarding Project 3.  Project 3 is due October 22 at 8 pm.  Please keep the followups related to questions in this post only.. . Additional project slides for general overview and tips on the project: @1554..  . Q: I've never played Euchre before, how do I learn the rules of the game?. A: Pages 2-5 of the spec detail the rules of ""EECS 280 Euchre"". Also, a staff member from prior semesters made a video tutorial a few years ago that may be helpful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jGJ0NRcrc. 0:33 Dealing. 1:55 The Upcard / Making Trump Round 1. 5:35 Making Trump Round 2. 7:20 Leading the First Trick. 8:20 The Other Players Play Cards in the First Trick. 10:58 Deciding who Wins the First Trick. 11:24 Leading the Second Trick. 12:00 Playing the Rest of the Hand. 20:30 Scoring. 21:23 Determining Whether Another Hand should be Played - Ending. . Q: Can I add helper functions while implementing the Player classes?. You are allowed to use helper functions, but these helper functions should not change the interface of the class. So within your implementations of the class's member functions, feel free to call helpers. But in your test files, you should not assume that these functions exist (because you should not alter the interface for the classes). This also applies in your euchre driver as well! e.g. If you add a helper function to the simple player class, you can use it within that class, but you can't use it in the driver since it won't be part of the Player interface!.  . This is especially important because when we run your test cases against an intentionally buggy solution, that solution will not have your specially defined helper functions! So just use the interfaces of each class when you test them.. . Q: Why am I getting a compiler error for calling sort? . Note that the sort function modifies the hand. You cannot modify member variables in a const function, so you'll receive a compiler error you call sort in a const member function.. . You shouldn’t need to sort using card less. When you print the hand in order it should be sorted using the < operator. You could sort with card less when determining what action to take, but you should be able to find the min/max card in the hand without sorting. You could use a functor to sort using card less, but those are only covered later in the course. Generally: if you need to use sort, just the default one will be fine..  . Q: Why am I passing euchre public test, but failing euchre public test with solution card, pack, and player?. This means that when your euchre.cpp is run with the instructor solution implementations of card, pack, and player you produce incorrect output. This likely means that you're making an incorrect assumption about what functionality should go in card/pack/player versus in the game of euchre. For example, make sure that you're not printing output in player.cpp that should be printed in euchre.cpp. .  . Q: Why won't pack.in open in pack public tests when running on Xcode?. Click on the name of your scheme in the toolbar at the top left, Edit Scheme > Options > Enable ""Custom Working Directory"" and press the little folder icon. Pick the folder that contains your code along with pack.in. This will ensure that the file is visible to your executable. This is usually not a problem, and we are investigating the issue..  . Q: How do I debug and add in command line arguments with XCode/VSCode/VS?. Follow this link  and click on your specific IDE, then click on the ""Arguments and options"" subsection..  . Q: Should I be printing the incoming arguments from the command line?. Yes, according to the spec: ""First, print the executable and all arguments on the first line. Print a single space at the end, which makes it easier to print an array."". . Q: Do I need to worry about the human player doing (insert illegal move) during the game?. No, in accordance with the spec you can assume that a human player will follow the rules of the game and will not attempt to cheat.. . Good luck and happy coding!. . extraorpinary"|750|0|active|||0
kuaa2zuo35i2ut|Can&#39;t clone partner&#39;s git files|"RESOLVEDMy partner followed the steps for version control for a team, and the starter files are in the ""master"" branch, with a README in the ""main"" branch on gitlab. She added me to the gitlab project as a ""maintainer"" as well. I have tried to clone the starter files from the gitlab project, but all I can clone using the HTTPS link is the README, and not the starter files in ""master"". How do I fix this?"|140|0|active|Glad you got it resolved! For anyone else having this issue, the problem is Git uses `master` as the default branch name but GitLab recently started using `main` is its default: https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/03/10/new-git-default-branch-name/ - so, you might end up in a situation where your repo has two different branches and your changes are getting pushed to these different branches rather than to the same one.. . The most straight-forward fix would be to agree between your partner on which branch you want to use, and make sure locally that you're only working on that branch e.g. if you wanted to just use `main`, you would run the command. ```. git checkout main. ```. There might be other issues too, like what if you had a bunch of changes on `master` that you wanted to move over to `main`, or how to get rid of `master` so you only have one branch - that's a little harder to explain in piazza post and it might vary by your individual situation, so I'd recommend going to office hours if you have that question||0

ktu7syugwi4ab|matrix_at Question|"I'm confused about how to set a new pointer to ""pointing"" at the value of a member of the matrix struct (data).  . . As arguments for this function we have *mat pointer, column #, and row #.  In my mind, the way to set this new pointer is to index through data (in the Matrix struct) with respect to the given column # and row # (these translate into the # of elements in array 'data').  It's at this point that I want to use a pointer initialized at the top of the function (i.e:   int* ptr;) to point to this value in 'data'.. . Then I return the pointer ptr.  The problem being, each time I try to translate this into code, I get errors.  ptr = mat -> data[(row and column iterator).    This is my thought process can anyone help me work through this?"|279|0|active|I think the problem you're having is that the subscript operator (`[]`) automatically dereferences the pointer, so you're trying to assign a value (an `int`) into a pointer. I think you need to use the address-of operator (`&`) on the right sign of the assignment for it to work.. . Also, worth mentioning that if you're assigning a pointer to `ptr` then returning `ptr`, you can just directly return the pointer you're trying to assign into `ptr`.||0
