kx6g5bm6tyb4ky|Submitted wrong files for p5|I just realized that I accidentally submitted the unmodified starter files I had on my computer instead of the files I worked on. I know that it is well past the deadline, but I was wondering if there was anything I could do about it. I didn't push to GitLab, so the only evidence I have for when I last worked on the project is anything that can be extracted from the files saved on my computer. |14|0|private|Please email eecs280staff@umich.edu and we will get back to you that way (if you haven’t already).||0

kx3rhvd9rz2ii|test function|. Hi my project is due tonight and I'm really stuck on this last part of the test function. I'm very confused on why I'm always getting the prediction to be euchre and why my values are so large.. Does anyone have any ideas?|8|0|private|Hey Kate, a few main things I can see:. . 1. Are you making sure to use the three different log-likelihood formulas from the spec, for the three different situations? I would take another look at this part of the spec: https://eecs280staff.github.io/p5-ml/#predicting-a-label-for-a-new-post. 2. When you are computing the log-probability score, I think you're overwriting the value each time, rather than computing the sum. The sum you want looks something like:. ```. log-prob-score = log-prior + log-likelihood-1 + log-likelihood-2 + ... + log-likelihood-n. ```. Whereas you're always setting the log-prob-score to `log-prior + log-likelihood-i`. . 3. When you're finding the best log-probability score, remember a higher log-probability score means its more likely. It looks like you're checking wrd.second < max_prob, so you're finding the lowest log-probability score instead.. . Hope that helps! And good luck, you're almost there!||2
kx3ork67duk6p4|Traverse Preorder testing|Hello,. I'm not sure how to properly test the traversal functions in BST. where am I going wrong? I'm trying to see if these stringstreams have a matching output.. |7|0|private|Note that `traverse_preorder()` is a void function and doesn't actually return anything, so we can't compare its return value to anything else. Instead, the traverse functions print their output to the stringstream you pass in (`ss` in your case). In order to get the strings out of a string stream, you should use the `.str()` method. . . So, if you want to compare if two strings streams s1 and s2 have the same content, you would check `s1.str() == s2.str()`. Hope that helps!||0
kx3n2xcgaac3on|log_prob|. Hi there, could anyone help me with how to get the correct log probability score/prediction?|9|0|private|"It's important to first make sure that your log-likelihood and log-priors are getting calculated correctly. You can run the test files with the debug flag and compare with the .correct file to make sure this is the case.. . This snippet of code looks somewhat correct to me, but there are a couple things. Note that the first for loop at the top is essentially doing nothing, since you are overriding the log_prior value at each iteration. Also, make sure you understand how the log probability for a label is calculated. To calculate the log probability for a label ""euchre"" and post with contents ""can the upcard"", we have to loop over all the words and add the log likelihood to some running total. After we've repeated that process for each label, we choose the highest log probability.. . Given that information, what order do you think the two loops should be in?"||1

Also, my main file will not allow me to use variables created in main in my classifier and vice-versa. How am I supposed to only print out the debug data if I can't check that argc == 4?|8|0|private|For your first question, word.size() returns a size_t type, to cast it to an int, you can do: . num_unique_words = (int)words.size();. .

Edit: Thank you for responding. Have you come to a decision yet?|116|1|active|Edit: let me follow up with the staffUpdate: After speaking with the instructors, we are unfortunately not be able to allow another submission. Making an exception wouldn't be fair to the rest of the students in the course, and there may well be others with a pretty small mistake somewhere that costs a lot of points.

My guess is you have a specific branch for if the value is equal to the current node, and you have some invalid access there. If you can’t find an invalid access anywhere, then it’s probably a problem with insert. Also note that if you run it with a debugger, you can run a backtrace to see exactly where the segfault occurred (and i think valgrind could be helpful here too)||0

kwzij4icd3s124|Map public test error|Whenever I try running the map public test, I keep getting this error after the first for loop that runs. Anyone know what might be going wrong? . |50|0|active|Sorry about the late answer! Based on your followup, it looks like its having an error with the for-each loop. Under the hood, this loop uses the iterators in your map class, which in-turn use the iterators from your BST class. I would look for an error somewhere there, although the error you were getting is strange - usually a bad_alloc only happens when some memory cannot be allocated. I would have run the map public test on caen using valgrind to help tell you where the error might be coming from, or stepped into the for loop using your debugger to narrow down where the issue is. ||1

Any idea what might be causing this? All my functions look okay, but I don't know if it's a common issue. |72|0|active|The print function relies on iterating over the nodes in the tree using a range based for loop.. I believe a range based for loop uses the postfix increment to move along an iterator pointing to an element of the container you're iterating over.. The postfix increment function uses the prefix increment function in our implementation.. The prefix increment for the Iterator of the BinarySearchTree class relies on the min_greater_than_impl and min_element_impl BST functions.. If you're having trouble printing a BST, I would visit those functions and test them to make sure they work as intended.||0

The first check should be whether the word, label pair exists in the map. If it does, then you can just get the log-likelihood from there. If it does not, you then need to check if that word exists in the dataset at all. If it does, then you find the log of the number of posts with that word divided by the total number of posts. If both of these cases do not work, then and only then do you want to default to the third case in which you find the log of 1 divided by the number of posts. . .

Lets say for the two examples name and animal if we wanted to store all the names in one vector and all the animal types in another. How can we program this to happen? It seems like the first time through a loop it does one column and the next time through it does the next column (in reverse order?) col.second will always coincide with the datum while col.first will always be the column name (animal or name). How does this help us?|178|0|active|"I'm not entirely sure what you are referring to in your example, but perhaps I can help by showing how to use csvstream to process data.. Let's use the small example csv from the project, test_small.csv (with line numbers on the left):. . . 1       n,unique_views,tag,content. 2       8,72,euchre,can the upcard ever be the left bower. 3       7,78,euchre,when would the dealer ever prefer a card to the upcard. 4       6,95,euchre,bob played the same card twice is he cheating. . csvstream allows you to process csv files row-by-row. Each row is read into a map<string, string> type, where the key of the map corresponds to the column names of the csv file (which are defined on the first line of each csv file, so for example ""n"", ""unique_views"", ""tag"", and ""content"" in our example) and the value corresponds to the actual cell data. Here's an example main file that does this:. . . int main() {.     // Open the file.     csvstream csvin(""test_small.csv"");. .     map<string, string> row;.  .     // Reads one row at a time.     while (csvin >> row) {.         // Extract ""n"" and ""tag"" column from the row.         cout << row[""n""] << "" "" << row[""tag""] << endl;. .         // This is where we'd process each row and.         // place it into our data structures.     }. }. And the output for our example would be:. . . 8 euchre. 7 euchre. 6 euchre. . since the while-loop extracts one row at a time, so one iteration would grab line 2, the next iteration would grab line 3, etc. until there is no input left. And we can read the value of a column for a row by using a column name as the key for the map (ex. row[""<column_name_from_csv_file>""]). Hope that clears it up!"||1

Remember that in your base case, you should immediately return a `nullptr` if `node` is `nullptr` and not try to access any of its members. Another problem you may be having is in the assignment operator.

kwuunrtpechku|nullptr issues|my destroy_nodes_impl is causing problems in one of our tests because we set one tree2 = tree1, so destroy is called to clear tree1 before copying over. however, as the delete node sets node to be junk values rather than nullptrs, when we check the size of tree2 it still returns the original size as we check if(!node) in size_impl. I'm confused because after I call delete node I also set node=nullptr, so I'm not sure why that isn't taking care of this. |107|0|active|Just a small note, setting `node = nullptr` in a function like `destroy_nodes_impl` just sets the local variables `node` to nullptr. That is a completely local effect, and doesn't change anything outside of the function, because again the variable `node` only exists inside that function and is passed by value. To sort of illustrate this, consider this example:. ```. void set_to_null(int * ptr) {.    ptr = null;. }. . int x = 4;         <--- some piece of data. int * y = &x;     <--- pointer that we can use. set_to_null(y);. . ASSERT_TRUE(y == nullptr);    <--- this fails. ``` . The reason the assertion fails is because the value of y (the memory address to x) is passed by value to ptr (meaning its just copied over) - to see this, you should treat the `set_to_null(y);` as declaring a new variable ptr: `set_to_null(int * ptr = y);`. We would have an outside effect if we passed by reference instead though, but for functions like `destroy_nodes_impl`, we aren't doing that (and we aren't allowed to change it to be pass-by-reference for this project either). So you have to deal with the pass-by-value instead.. . For your issue with the assignment operator, it could be a problem in two places: 1. with `destroy_nodes_impl`, specifically with how you implemented it recursively but also 2. with your implementation of `copy_nodes_impl`. I took a look at your most recent autograder submit though and youy implementations look fine, as well as the test you're describing. Is this still an issue for you?||0

kwusjb31gzf2n9|Sanity check- Map of Maps|"I'm planning out how I want to implement main.cpp, particularly the ""training"" section. In particular, I've been thinking about this requirement of the program: ""For each label C and word w, [record] the number of posts with label C that contain w"".. . The way I've been thinking might work would be to include a Map, where the Key is the word and the Value is another Map. This inner map would have a Key of each label that word is associated with, and the Value would be an Integer, representing the number of posts with that label in which this word appears.. . For obvious reasons, I'm hesitant to implement such a complicated solution. I believe the autograder has runtime requirements, and I could also be using a lot of memory (an entire Map) for every individual word. So, I just wanted to get a quick sanity check before I spend several days implementing a solution that may be inherently impractical or even flat-out incorrect.

Thanks You!|126|1|active|`Key_compare` is for comparing two keys. You will need to specify this type when constructing a map if you don't want it to default to `std::less`. `PairComp` is for comparing two `std::pair`s. The intention for Map is that you will somehow use a BST to accomplish most of the work for you, and you should consider how `PairComp` may be useful if you use a BST.||1

To see this, consider if Value_type was replaced with int - would `int v;` properly initialize v to 0, or would it be uninitialized instead?).. . Otherwise, if you've implemented Map below (I believe the project setup guide has you do this), then your functions looks something like:. ```. template . bool Map::empty() const {.   assert(false);. }. ``` . In which case the template type you need to use instead is V. So it would be something like `V()` rather than `Value_type()`||1

My base case is if the tree is empty then return nullptr, then I try to divide the case into whether the tree has a right or left branch or not. Am I on the right track?|140|0|active|You definitely are on the right track! As a reminder, there are essentially four conditions to the sorting invariant.

There are two major hurdles, imo, in this function: First, finding a way to use the comparator to check the first two conditions. This is where what you mentioned with thinking about the min/max comes in. Second, is finding a way to combine all four of these conditions such that if any one of them fails, the function returns false, and if all of them succeed, the function returns true.

Is this okay? Do we need to ensure the csv_stream exception message doesn't print and abort as well and just ours? if so how do we override that?. thank you"|129|0|active|I'm not 100% sure whether or not the csv_exception text is allowed to be there or not, but here are some ways to deal with it so it isn't:. . The reason the correct message is showing is because `csvstream_exception::what()` returns a string in the correct format (i.e. your code to print the error message isn't ever running). The easiest way to print just the message then, I think, is to put the `csvstream` construction in a `try` block, and catch `csvstream_exception`. In your catch block, you should print `e.what()` and return a non-zero exit code.. . The other way to do this, which is slightly more clunky but doesn't require any exception handling, is to attempt to open the file using `fstream` and use the `.is_open()` function we used in other projects. If the file does open properly, then construct a `csvstream`, and if not, print an error message and return a non-zero exit code||0

Using the classifier, for every line in the test data, predict what the correct output label should be. . . Now, in my opinion, it's easier to get started by getting #2 and #3 working before doing #1 (e.g. by hardcoding file names). A simple starting `main` function could read in `train_small.csv`, pass the file to your classifier training function(s), and print out the debug output (specified [here](https://eecs280staff.github.io/p5-ml/#output) in the spec). . .

Natural Language Processing is giving  ""computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can"" and though our project is not the most advanced or accurate form, it is making a program somehow process or ""understand"" sentences and paragraphs and provide a label based on its ""understanding"". The ""understanding"" part is achieved through training."||0

kwplrzfae8y2yb|Map_public_test issues|Hi! I have two quick points on Map_public_test and I'm looking for some guidance.. . The first (and simpler) is the problem I'm getting on line 61: testing the default-created value when a previously-undefined key is called.. . . . The number I'm generating is functionally 0, so incredibly close to 0 that it would be rounded to 0 in almost any case. However, this isn't good enough for the test. Should I be hard-coding my operator[] overload such that, if value_type is int, set default value to 0?. . Second question for the following test:. . . . The problem I'm having is in line 30, though it isn't actually registered until the assert on line 48. Take a look at the variables to see what I'm talking about:. . . . For some reason, the pi pair is on the left branch, while the others aren't. On the loop from 42-47, both the hello and world pairs are correctly copied over, but the for statement on 42 doesn't even look at the pi pair, and I'm guessing that's because it's on the left rather than the right. The final actual_keys and actual_values have two values each, for hello and world. When I step deep into the functions, though, everything seems to be working as intended until insert_impl, where the Key_compare simply decides that pi is less than world.. . I feel like I'm simply missing something here. Any idea why the loop on 42-47 won't run a third time? If it's because the comparator is supposed to find pi greater than world, any idea why that's not happening for me?|7|0|private|"Regarding your first issue: how are you default initializing values in your `operator[]`? If you're using `Value_type()` or `V()`, that should be properly initializing the value. (also in that test case, the Value_type is double). . For your second issue: the structure of your BST looks correct since the nodes are organized alphabetically (""hello"" < ""pi"" < ""world""). Instead it could be an issue with your Iterator, since the for each loop uses Iterators under the hood I believe - based on the comment right above, its equivalent to:. ```. for (Map::Iterator it = words.begin(); it != words.end(); ++it) { ... }. ```. So I might take a look at your BST iterator (which if you look at the implementation of `&operator++`, you'll notice it uses your `min_element_impl` and `min_greater_than_impl` functions)"||1

I do not need to set it to a temporary variable then access it correct?|6|0|private|Yeah that should be fine, but I don’t think you need the .first - when you call insert(), it should return an Iterator to a pair, and operator[] should be returning a reference to the value (the second thing in the pair). In your example, you would be calling .second on the whatever .first is. . Slightly longer answer: the return value of operator[] is a reference to something of type Value_type, so we just need to make sure the reference isn’t to something of local scope to the function that will get destroyed once the function ends, which would make the returned reference invalid (referencing destroyed memory). In this case, we need to return a reference to the value associated with the key in the map, and the map is storing its data in a BST - so, if we return something in the BST, which is a member variable of the map, we should be okay. You could store the return value of insert in a separate Iterator member variable. When we dereference this iterator, we get the pair stored in the BST, and that’s what we need to make sure isn’t a local/temporary variable. Again though, we’rejust interested in the value for this pair. ||2

This is kind of a tricky function - the main challenge is that you're creating a new Node, and need some way to attach it to the rest of the tree. Here are just a couple pieces of advice:. 1. Pointers aren't default initialized to nullptr, so you need to set that yourself. In your base case, you create a new Node, but are we making sure to set all of the member variables of that Node, or are there things we haven't initialized yet?. 2. `insert_impl` should only create a Node in the base case. In all other cases, it just delegates the work to the recursive call, so you shouldn't need to create a new Node in the other cases. This is where you should take the recursive leap of faith, and just treat the recursive call like a regular old function -  pretend the `insert_impl` call does what you want it to (inserts the node somewhere in the left or right subtree) and either returns the Node you passed in or the Node that you created - right now we aren't using the return value, is there some way we could use it that would helps us with linking up the tree?. 3. Try thinking through some simple examples: What happens with an empty tree? What happens with a tree with a single node? What about a tree with 3 nodes? These are small enough examples where you can reason about all the recursion going on without too much trouble, if it still feels weird taking the recursive leap of faith. .

kwo7inos5n16z|Map error|hi! Can i get help with this?. |6|0|private|Hey! The error you're seeing comes from the return type of the `operator[]` function. Notice its returning a reference to something of Value_type - that's what the `&` means. If we didn't have the `&`, then we'd be returning a copy of the value (this is the same thing as pass-by-value vs pass-by-reference, but for return values instead). But since we do, when you return p.second, you're actually returning a reference to the local stack variable p inside the function - that local variable gets destroyed when the function returns, but we just returned a reference to it, meaning that reference will always be invalid (referencing destroyed memory).. . To fix this, we need to be returning a reference to something that exists after the function return, specifically something in the tree. Remember that `tree.insert()` returns an iterator, which points to the just-inserted node in the tree - could we return something involving that instead? ||0

kwo42fvv5kg435|maps vs pairs|"Hello, I am wondering what the difference would be between map<string, map<string, int>> and map<string, pair<string, int>> would be? This would be for gathering ""each label C and word w, the number of posts with label C that contain w."" in my driver. I believe that a map holds a collection of pairs, but I do not understand what the difference would be in this case."|105|0|active|In the first case, when you query with a string, you get back a map of strings to integers. Essentially, it’s a “2d map” where the values are integers. In the second case, when you query the map with a string, you get back a single value. That value happens to be a pair which contains a string and an integer. This could maybe be useful if you were trying to get a key to be associated with 2 different values, but in this case you should probably either use 2 separate maps or a custom type as your value type||1

In the first tree the correct answer is 4 and in the second tree the answer is 7. How do you ""go back up"" the tree once finding there is no right subtree of val?"|129|2|active|"Just to add onto the student answer:. . I'd say this is the function where you most need to remember to take the recursive leap of faith, and to avoid thinking about the recursion as ""going down"" or ""going up"". Treat the recursive call as just a regular function call that does what you want it to do, and inside the function, try to frame your thinking more as just handling the different possible cases for finding the min-greater-than Node in the given tree.. . More specifically, here are a couple of pieces of advice:. . * We have access to the function `min_greater_than_impl` - even though we're still implementing it, let's just pretend it works like a separate helper function and returns the minimum Node still greater than val for whatever tree we pass in (so long as it isn't the tree  rooted at the current Node). Try to see how you can use this function on a sub-tree, keeping in mind that it will return either: 1. nullptr if the search fails or 2. a valid Node pointer if the search succeeds. (This is what Shubh is describing in the followup). * Avoid looking at the datums of any Node besides the `node` parameter - so try not to look at the datum of the left or right children. Let the recursion do the work of looking at the subtree (see the first bullet point). * A common pitfall with recursion when implementing this function is that usually we see recursion as travelling or moving across the tree in one direction. This works for most of the other functions, but not really here. Like I mentioned above, try to only look at this point in the recursion, only at this Node, and think about it in terms of the different cases for this particular Node (these are what your base and recursive cases are), using `min_greater_than_impl` like a helper function (see the first bullet point).. * Remember that you can make a recursive call, but still do work on the return value (which is a little easier to see when you start treating `min_greater_than_impl` like a helper function, rather than seeing it as a recursive call that's travelling to another part of the tree). . This is definitely a tricky function, so feel free to followup!. . .  "||1
kwnzo21ryu34ty|Completely lost with Project 5, need extra help|EECS Staff, . For the past week, I have been working on trying to figure out Project 5, and while I think I have mostly gotten BinarySearchTree working (i hope), I am completely lost with where to even begin with Map.h, even with the simplest functions. For the week and a half before thanksgiving, I was sick and missed most of the lectures pertaining to this project, and trying to figure things out based off of the slides has not been working. Is it possible for me to meet with someone for like an hour or so sometime over the next couple days to try and understand exactly what I need to do with the project moving forward? I really need help with understanding the syntax for functors, iterators, and how exactly I am supposed to use BinarySearchTree in Map.h. . Thanks,. Nick Hajjar|21|0|private|Hi Nick,. . There are a few things I can recommend here.. Come to office hours! We are more than happy to help you understand concepts that are still confusing and help you understand how to go about starting the project. Proffice hours would also be a great resource for this! Additionally, if you have a coach, talking to them about these concepts at your next meeting can be super helpful. Think about attending weekend office hours, too.Understand that Maps are simply BSTs with key, value pairs as the datum. On top of this, they support the [] operator, which is detailed in the RME and is simply a mix of a find and insert. Once you understand this and think about how to utilize all of the functions you already wrote in BST, you'll find that this is a lot easier to implement (Map should not be much code if you have a working BST class).Watch this. This is a great introduction to the project by a former IA and can really help you understand implementations and begin working on Map.Read through the course notes and do your best to catch up on lecture as soon as possible. You still have 8 days to complete the project, and it sounds like you already have most of BST done. As you understand the concepts more and write some more code, the syntax for everything in Map will start to click and everything will fall into place. . . Unfortunately, we cannot meet with students outside of an EECS 280 setting as that would be unfair to other students. However, the above suggestions should help you get going.  I hope this helps, and good luck to you!. ||0

However, when we search something in a map, we're only searching by the key in the pair - in order to translate this to the BST, you need to construct a pair with some placeholder value.

This also concerns me that a tree will not be created correctly.

For example, if you had a `vector`, you would be able to write code like `*it = 5`, and so we don't want the interface to be completely different for a BST. More relevant to the project, if our dereference operator returned a const reference, we wouldn't be able to modify objects in our map since `(*it).second = 4` would not be possible, but we want to be able to update values in the map.

I'm not totally sure how the floating point precision stuff works - but I'm led to believe that cout.precision(3) doesn't has any effect on the printed output of 49 because it only has 2 digits. As the vocabulary size gets larger (1000+) and ""--debug"" is used, do we need to use floating point precision for vocabulary size? Or is it just printed out like the way the number of examples is?"|105|0|active|It's not that floating point precision isn't being used, its that the vocabulary size is being printed as an integer, like `cout ||0

kwlx00ggds74gb|P5: BinarySearchTree in Map -  Pointer or Object?|So, as our Map is essentially storing up a BST under the hood, should we store the BST as a pointer or as an object within Map?I am asking since the slides from the P5 walkthrough session seems to suggest (by wording) that we need to store the BST as an object rather than a pointer, as indicated below:. . . Besides, I also feel it is more efficient in terms of memory to store BST as a pointer/|176|2|active|TL;DR: You would probably want to store it as an object. . There are a few considerations you need to make when storing something on the heap:. 1. Is the object really big (in which case we need the extra space in the heap). 2. Does the object need to have an extended lifetime (in which case we want to control the lifetime ourselves). . For memory size, remember that the BST already stores all of its Nodes on the heap as dynamic memory, so by having the BST object on the heap as well, you would only be storing a little bit more memory on the heap. But, the stack is more than enough space to handle that, so we don't necessarily need to put it on the heap.. . In terms of lifetime, this BST would be a member variable of the Map object so its lifetime should really just be the same as the lifetime of the overall Map object. If we had the BST as a pointer on the heap, then we'd need to implement the Big 3 in order to not leak memory and to have the lifetime of that BST be the same as the Map. If we had the BST as an object, then its lifetime is automatically the same as the Map, and will get constructed, destructed, and copied just fine.. . All that's to say: there isn't a great reason to put the BST on the heap, and if we did put it on the heap, then we'd have to implement the Big 3 too (which is extra work). So, its probably a good idea to just keep it as an object unless we have good reason otherwise.||0

So its not about if this tree contains an invariant, instead its whether it meets / satisfies the invariant.. . For the BST, we have a sorting invariant outlined in the spec - that means a proper BST always has that pattern or condition.

kwli9hz3hbd5ok|insert_impl linking|I've been stuck on how to link the new node to its parent node (or, technically, assign the parent's right or left pointer to the new node). From my understanding of my code, when the function travels down the tree, correctly going either right or left, it'll eventually reach the bottom. This is signified by the root node no longer being a node (!node in the if statement). Here, I create a new node and set the address of the new node to the root node (which is not really a root anymore since it reached the bottom); that's my attempt at linking them, but it doesn't seem to work. Any insight is appreciated!. . |5|0|private|When we set `newNode = node`, that isn't really affecting the structure of the BST (which is held together using the left/right pointers on each node) - what ends up happening is we just set the value of the local variable `newNode` to be the same address as `node` (which in this branch will be `nullptr`). In order to link it up properly, we need to modify the parent node's left/right pointer, which we can't do at this point in the recursion.. . I would actually encourage you to not reason about the recursion or trace through it too much. Rather, just consider the different cases independently for this function at a single point in the recursion, and take the recursive leap of faith and just treat `insert_impl` as a helper function that does what you want it to. On that second point, also remember that `insert_impl` returns a Node pointer, which is either going to be the Node you pass in (if that Node already exists) or a completely new Node (if it doesn't exist) - would that return value help us link up the tree?. .

So now that you’ve created an arbitrary Value and you have the Key from the parameter to the function, you can make a pair and then pass that to find in BST. Your return value will then give you an iterator, which you can dereference to return from find() in Map||1

The root that its asking you to return is the tree rooted at node, not the absolute root of whatever larger tree there possibly could be - remember that trees are recursive data structures, and that each node is the root of its own subtree. When you recursively call copy nodes on these subtrees, try to just treat it as a completely new tree rather than considering the actual start of the recursion at the absolute root of the whole tree - at each recursive call, we have no way of really knowing whether we're the absolute root or not, but we don't really need to think about that to copy this particular tree and return the root at this point (which is just node)||1

For example, you could be destroying all the nodes properly, but when you insert a datum into the BST, you might accidentally create a new Node every recursive call, creating a whole bunch of nodes that don't get linked up with the tree - all of those nodes would be leaked memory.. . General advice - look for where you create Nodes with `new` . and make sure it's getting linked up to the tree, and where you change around the pointers on the Node to make sure no Nodes are getting lost. The valgrind error output should tell you more specifically where you should look - it should also tell you the test case where the memory is getting leaked, which can narrow down the places you need to look (since each test case will only run through some set of functions, so you can be confident the leak happens in one of those functions).

If we tried to insert a value to a specific key twice, we would just overwrite the same value, rather than creating two different pairs both with the same key. Because we're implementing our map using a BST, we're going to be storing key/value pairs in each node of the BST. In order to insert a new key/value pair into the BST or find a pair, we need some way to compare two different pairs to check for less than/greater than to decide whether to go in the left/right subtree, or if we have equality.. . Say we did implement PairComp such that it compared both the key and the value - that would mean we could insert (""key1"", 2) and (""key1"", 3), and they would end up creating two different nodes because their values make them different according to PairComp. In addition, when we're looking up keys in our map to get the corresponding value, we don't want to have to specify the value too when searching because that's the thing we're looking for in the first place. So, in order to avoid creating separate nodes with the same key and to allow for searching just by the key, we ignore the second value in the pair when doing comparison.. .

It's difficult to say exactly what is happening from your output, but check the places where you're inserting into the map that you ultimately print from.

You should never check the existence of a key in a map with the [] operator. In the case that the key does not exist, the [] will insert a default constructed object.. . Consider this case where we have a map letters full of {letter, frequency} pairs that show us how many times each letter appears in a (all lowercase) word..

Because `datum` and `val` are both of type T, its going to try to find the == operator for that type.

It claims to be  in my find_impl implementation and after much use of my debugger I believe I have located the problem. for some reason after the recursive part of my code iterates the tree to the last node with a value, instead of the next node it checks to be a nullptr and then stop ( considering there are no more values in the BST to search), it holds a random value from memory and continues to search for terminating nullptr.  |119|0|active|It's hard to tell for sure, but maybe the `left` and `right` members of `Node` aren't being set the `nullptr` properly in your `insert_impl`, so it has no way of knowing that the last node is the last one.||0

Just like project 4, you can either do these inline (implementing them right in the class declaration) or provide the implementations below the class declaration (where you'd do scope resolution with `::` to specify which function you're implementing - this is described in more detail in the section of the spec I linked).

kw82svcpwyz5q9|Differentiate between empty node and base node?|For empty_impl in the bst.h I am saying a node is empty if the node's left and right are null pointers. But then the base node in a tree of size 1 would fit the description of empty, when it's not empty. Is this not the right way to check empty?|168|2|active|I'd be cautious of this. You are correct that the root node of the tree will have left and right set to nullptr, and the tree would still not be empty since there is a root node. Remember that we keep track of the root node of a tree for each BST, so what can we check instead? empty_impl will be called with the root of a valid tree (whether this be the entire tree or a subtree), keep that in mind.||1

kw6og4wvy2wzn|Hash Maps Vs Maps in C&#43;&#43;|I know that we don't need to know what a hash map is yet, but I came across it when trying to learn about maps. So from what I could gather, hash maps and maps are the same thing but a hash map is unordered. Also it seems that hash maps are typically implemented as a table data structure and maps as a binary search tree. Are these assumptions correct, and is there anything that I'm missing?|117|1|active|Hash maps can be thought of as tables where insertion is constant time O(1) and lookup is also O(1) in best cases. When iterating through a hash map, there is no guaranteed order of the elements. Hash maps are really good for if you need to do a lot of lookups and don't necessarily care about the order of your data or the relationships between the data elements in your hash map.. . In comparison, an ordered_map (aka a BST) is a binary tree-like structure. Insertion is typically O(logn) and search is also O(logn). That said, when iterating through an ordered map, we do have a guaranteed order of the elements. Ordered maps (trees) are useful for many directed graph problems and when we care about the order in which we inserted our elements and the order of those elements with respect to each other.||0

Thanks!|135|0|active|You are correct in that you can't call the function directly. You may indirectly test it when you are testing the overloaded assignment operator (which calls destroy_node_impl).

I was just wondering if anyone had any insight on this strange behavior. Thanks!|143|1|active|Strange/inconsistent behavior is almost always because of weird or invalid memory accesses, such as using uninitialized memory. Running valgrind on CAEN is a good way to figure out where that might be happening - you can also use your test cases to help narrow down which functions have memory bugs, if you have few enough test cases that are relatively short.. . Also remember that pointers don't default initialize to nullptr (even if they're inside a struct), so that can be a pretty easy way to get invalid memory accesses that can throw off your program. For example, if you do something like:. ```. int * x;. if (!x) {. .... } else {. .... }. ```. x is an uninitialized pointer, so your program will take different branches on different runs based on if the junk memory it was set to happened to make it a nullptr or not.||2

Antisymmetric: a < b and b < a cannot be both true (this can be deduced from the first two if the first two are true). |192|1|active|You can assume all of the following about the less comparator.

kw11ptrmfwa2e3|Functors vs functions|Hi,. . I'm just a little confused on what's the benefit of using a functor over a regular function? I understand a functor is an object and not a method, but why does that help?|144|1|active|"One of the big benefits is that functors can hold state. With function pointers, we can already store functions into variables. But, that doesn't mean that we can dynamically create functions to do slightly different things. By using the overloaded function call operator of a class, we can instantiate that class with a different variable each time. The ""GreaterN"" from [here](https://eecs280staff.github.io/notes/19_Functors_Impostor_Syndrome.html#functors) is a good example of dynamically creating the functor with different values.. . From a practical standpoint, why would we want to use a functor instead of a custom function? A lot of times, you wouldn't want to use a functor. But, when combined with functions that take in predicates, comparators, or other types of functors, we can recombine and re-use functionality to very simply ""compose"" more complicated functions. e.g. instead of rewriting our own sorting algorithm in order to sort Euchre Cards according to the trump suit and led card, we could easily convert our Card_less function into a comparator, and pass it into std::sort, which accepts any comparator!"||0

kvzq3qwxdt41ey|Project 5 FAQ|"Refer to this post for Frequently Asked Questions regarding Project 5. Please keep the followups related to questions in this post only. The FAQ will be updated as the project progresses, so please check back here before posting a new question!. . Check @3301 for P5 Intro session recording and check this link for the slides that were presented for that intro session.. . Q: I've never worked with maps before.  Where can I get a crash course about map functionality?. . A: Staff last semester made a p5 walkthrough video! Check it out here!  In addition, another staff member made this video a few years ago detailing a general overview of what they are and how you can use them.  In addition here is a playlist for additional help related to p5..  . Q: Should I use my Map.h implementation in the driver?. . A: DO NOT DO THIS. Your implementation of Map is inefficient, and will cause problems down the road. Use the standard library implementation of map instead. (#include <map>) Great documentation can be found at http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/map/. . Q: I want to test if an Iterator points to a nullptr, how can I do this?. . A: You're probably trying to compare the iterator to nullptr like this: ASSERT_EQUAL(iter, nullptr);. Because these two aren't of the same type, the unit testing framework will probably complain. Instead see if you can compare two objects of the same type - Iterator - which have the same value..  . Q: What is less? What is std::less<T>? How do I use less? . . A: less is a private member variable of BST.. . It is an instance of a comparator class whose type is Compare. Compare is a template type. std::less<T> is a functor class in the stl that compares two elements of type T using the < operator. By default, Compare will be std::less<T>.. . In the BinarySearch_compile_check.cpp, there is an example of a BST with the default Compare and a BST with a custom comparator. . . . In the first case, the template will be instantiated like . Node *root;. std::less<int> less;. In the second case, the template will be instantiated like . Node *root;. DuckWealthLess less; .  . Q: What could be a cause of incorrect accuracy? . . A: Make sure you're properly handling duplicate words. Make sure ties are properly handled. Make sure log-probabilities are not being rounded due to being stored in an incorrect type..  . Q: How do I record ""For each label L and word w, the number of posts with label L that contain w""? . . A: You'll need a more complex data structure, since you'll need to store three pieces of information - the label, the word, and the count. There are at least two different ways to do this. Hint: The key type and/or value type of a map can be a class..  . Q: Why do my test cases compile on Caen but not the autograder?. . A: Double check that you haven't broken the public interface and added a public function. Also, do not put using namespace std in a header file..  . Q: What's a csvstream and how do I use it? . . A: There are three really helpful examples at https://github.com/awdeorio/csvstream..  . Q: Do we need to check for duplicates in our check_sorting_invariants_impl?. . A: Your check_sorting_invariants_impl checks for a valid BST. A tree with duplicates is not a valid binary search tree. The most definitive and unambiguous description of the invariant you need to check for is described in the sorting invariants section of the spec. To be extra clear, if you were to call check_sorting_invariants on a tree that has duplicates in the right subtree, it should return false..  . Q: VSCode syntax highlighting is breaking on BinarySearchTree.h and Map.h!. . A: This appears to be a bug in VSCode 1.33 regarding default template parameters. We've found a few workarounds, probably the simplest of which is to add a comment to the template declaration:. .  . Q: How fast does my code need to run?. . A: You should aim for the large test case to run within a minute or so. For reference, the instructor solution takes about 5 seconds on this test case..  . Q: My code is too slow. What might be the reason?. . A: Common sources of slowness include:. . Processing a post more than once (including reading it more than once or saving all the data in a vector).. . Iterating over a map to find something rather than using [] or find().. . Passing strings or containers by value.. . Iterating by value in a range-based for loop.. . machinelearning"|706|0|active|||0
kvzg8qcvdcp7il|Blazing Fast Starter File Setup|Hey all,. . If you've ever found starter file setup tedious, you will find this useful.. . I wrote a short program that sets up EECS 280 project files in __one command__, including:. - downloading and extracting the project zip file and removing junk files,. - removing all `.starter` file suffixes, and. - moving everything to a custom-named folder (optional). . To try it out for Project 5:. ```. git clone https://github.com/andkerr/280setup.git. . cd 280setup          # navigate to the cloned repository. . ./280setup p5-ml     # run to set up your files. ```. For more information, see [the Github repository](https://github.com/andkerr/280setup).. . . The script has been tested on the EECS 280-approved command line tools (WSL, macOS terminal, Linux).|166|6|active|||1
kvtzhpuqlqn7jh|Make style in CAEN|I'm confused as to whether there is an actual error. If there is, how do I know what the error is. It says error reading api.cpp, but I never added it because we don't need it. . . Also if there is any error in our code, will all the styles fail??. . |60|0|active|The easiest way to check style is probably to just submit to the Autograder for this project because of this reason. The Autograder doesn't have this bug. Also, the style check will not run unless the code compiles in the Autograder.||1

kvszhnlg98g76w|Any tips on how to test the push functions?|Should I create string streams and compare them to the list? I would need to create a helper function, right? Or is there some other obvious way that I've missed?|91|0|active|you can’t create a public helper function because you can’t change the public interface. What I did was create a c-style array with the values in the correct order and then iterated through the List and the array simultaneously ||0
kvrlm1jndyp1ji|Dereferencing pointer|Are we allowed to access the next element this way? If we are, why do I keep getting this error, and what does it mean?. . |104|0|active|This means you are attempting to set the `prev` member variable of `nullptr`. The problem is that `first` doesn't refer to a `Node`, and so you can't dereference it. Assign `first` to point to a `Node`, then you can write the line you have there. This may be an issue with some special case with an empty `List`||0
kvrl0494js25bb|Iterator in List public function|Do we have to use the iterator in our List member functions like pop_front()?|103|0|active|Since your `List` member functions are inside the class, you're able to interact with the `Node` objects directly, so it isn't necessary. It may make your code cleaner depending on implementation but I think that's up to you||0
