If a regular user wanted to just run a single command with elevated permissions, they could use `sudo`, and so long as they're a user with sudo permission, the terminal will run the command afterwards with elevated permissions.. . In your situation, CAEN doesn't allow students to have sudo permission so it just told you that was the case (see https://teamdynamix.umich.edu/TDClient/76/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=5055). Unfortunately this means you can't install software on the CAEN computers yourself - I'll see about getting the spec updated, since I don't think it's accurate.

It says my main type isn't correct.|7|0|private|Sorry about the late answer after the deadline - It looks like an issue with uninitialized values. After you call `Matrix_init` (depending on how you implemented it), max won't have any specific value initialized in its data array. So even though most of the values are 0, they could all have been anything. To fix this test, you'd have to initialize every value in max before setting values and printing it, either iteratively using `Matrix_at` or using `Matrix_fill`.. . Regarding your other question about your `resize.cpp` - it looks like the main function wasn't declared properly. In your case, you had something like:. ```. main{. .... }. ```.

Why do we need a pointer for things like¬† the height and width but not for the filename and strings?. Sorry if this is a dumb question|72|0|active|Sorry about the late answer after the project deadline. I'm not sure what you mean exactly about pointers to height and width, but I can clarify what's going on with argv though.. . Looking at the type of argv, its written as `char *argv[]`. So, it's a C-style array of `char *`'s. In this case, we interpret each char pointer as pointing to the first element of a C-style string - remember that C-style strings are just char arrays with a null terminating character `\0`, so we can read the entire string by going from the pointer to the head until we hit this null terminator.. . So bottom line, argv is just a list of strings, and when we access argv like `argv[0]`, then we get a C-style string. We can convert this into a C++ style string like so:. ```. std::string first_argument = argv[0]. ```.

But if you can't call Image_init without checking if the values of width/height are < 500px, then I'm not sure how you access this data. So can we assume that resize will never be called with an image that has width/height exceeding 500px?|80|0|active|It can be assumed that the width and height of the image are less than 500px each. However, it can't hurt to write some assert statements in Image_init or resize.||0

ku7ilkgtzlb5ju|seam_carve_width calling functions|For this function, me and my partner are at odds about whether to use the desired width of the image (if yes, how do I call the inputted width)? As for calling the functions, I noticed that the seam_carve_width takes in an Image and an integer but a lot of the functions that need to be called call in 2 matrices. How do I navigate this?. |9|0|private|seam_carve_width is a function that should reduce the width of a given Image to be newWidth by using the seam carving algorithm as described in the spec. Think of this algorithm as each function producing some data that can be then passed on and used by another function and so on. Our first two steps of the algorithm are to compute the energy matrix, then the cost matrix -- which tells us what the 2 matrices are that we are working with. Make sure you understand why the algorithm is structured as it is, and what the order of the functions tells us about how seam_carve_width should achieve its purpose. The goal here is to understand each function of the algorithm and its overall structure and flow.||0

I'm trying to debug the find_minimal_vertical_seam() function and I'm having trouble figuring out why the last value for the seam is 0 instead of 1. I've checked the logic a few times and it makes sense to me, since theoretically min_col - 1 = 1 (min_col = 2 in this case), so logically the 0 column shouldn't even be an option (as shown in the code/terminal output below).. . . . Also, when I'm generating the original min_col, shouldn't it be:. . . because the column_end input for the Matrix_column_of_min_value_in_row() function is exclusive? It's really confusing to me, since when I do that, the assert fails within the function as expected, since the max width is set to Matrix_width(mat), however that logic works in the for loop which is confusing to me.. . If possible, could you please help point me in the right direction? Thank you.|10|0|private|Hint 1: The seam array consists of the column numbers of the minimum cost pixel in each row. On line 213, you set min_col to be the column of the minimum value in the last row (Matrix_height(cost) - 1). Where should you store this value within the seam array? Based on your for loop, which iterates from the bottom of the image to the top, how should you iterate through and store values in the seam array?. . Hint 2: Try stepping through the visual debugger to see what entry gets updated in the seam array throughout this function. Is there an instance where the same entry gets updated twice? If so, how can you fix that?. . Regarding your question about generating the original min_col, remember that the indices in an array of size n go from 0 to n - 1, so if column_end is equal to the width of the Matrix, it is already one past the last index, which agrees with the exclusive behaviour of Matrix_column_of_min_value_in_row().¬†||0

For example, the PPM header says an image has dimensions 5x10 but the RGB data itself is actually for an 3x5 image.

My intuition for how to solve this problem would be to calculate the minimal vertical seam for each endpoint on the bottom row, and then choose whatever seam has the lowest sum of all of the costs.

The last sentence of this paragraph in the spec shows how to do that:. > Each of the functions in the `Image` module takes a pointer to the`Image` that is supposed to be operated on. When you are writing implementations for these functions, you may be tempted to access members of the `Matrix` struct directly (e.g. `img->red_channel.width`, `img->green_channel.data[x]`). Don‚Äôt do it! They aren‚Äôt part of the interface for `Matrix`, and you should not use them from the outside. Instead, use the `Matrix` functions that are part of the interface (e.g. `Matrix_width(&img->red_channel)`, `Matrix_at(&img->green_channel, r, c)`).||0

On the other hand, pixels sort of encapsulate a specific location within these channels - it is a structural combination of one location from each channel.. As you move forward with the project (ie. implementing processing.cpp), you will see that it is more useful to have access to a full pixel rather than accessing the red, green & blue channels of a matrix.

However, she added me to her project on GitLab and I did not add her to mine. I'm not sure what to do exactly to ""undo"" what I should've left for only her to do; I deleted my remote repo on GitLab and attempted to clone hers, which I am set as a maintainer for, but my terminal gives me an error that ""the destination path exists and is not an empty directory.""

ktoomitabeg2yk|Project 2 FAQ|"Refer to this post for Frequently Asked Questions regarding Project 2. Project 2 is due Friday, October 1 at 8pm.¬† Please keep the followups related to questions in this post only.. . Spec is here.¬† Introduction slides for this project are here.¬† Find partners to work with via @5.. Resize GUI repository (you can use this to easily try your resize code on other images!): https://github.com/oalejel/resize-GUI. Write clear code! This is especially important for this project, remember:Matrix width = # of columnsMatrix height = # of rowsInstead of using variables like ""i"" and ""j"" in your for-loops, consider using ""row"" and ""col"" so you don't get confused!Q: Am I required to use traversal by pointer?A: No. You are allowed to, but not required to use traversal by pointer in this project. You should choose to traverse by index/pointer based on what makes sense to you logically.Q: My program takes a couple minutes or more to run. Is this expected? A: Yes, but not too long - your program should run in under 30 seconds. Double check that you're not looping unnecessarily or calling an inefficient function within a loop. Perf is also a helpful tool for improving efficiency! https://eecs280staff.github.io/p2-cv/#appendix-b-perf-tutorialQ: Rotate left is failing, even though it was provided. Is there an error in the provided function? A: Rotate left calls several student implemented image functions, which can cause errors in rotate left.Q: Why do I have to write functions like Matrix_width? Couldn't I just use matrix->width directly?A: Unless you're implementing a Matrix function, this is generally considered really poor design! We actually consider this incorrect behavior, even if you get the right results, so please make sure you use the right function. Even if it's just Matrix_width and Matrix_height, whenever you're not writing Matrix functions, go through the interface - the same goes for Image as well.Q: Do I have to respect the interface when writing tests?A: Yes, tests should always respect the interface! In the real world, this means you can reuse tests when changing the implementation to make sure that you haven't also changed the interface, such that you can avoid updating the code everywhere the interface is used!Q: How can I test Matrix_at without breaking the interface?A: When thinking of unit testing, you should think in units as behavior instead of units as functions, because it is common to have functions like Matrix_at that solely rely on the underlying implementation. When testing Matrix_at, we really want to test the behavior of setting and retrieving independent values reliably from our matrix. For example, you could test that setting a value at (0,1) doesn't modify the value at (1,0) or other similar variations of this.Q: What does it mean for the column start to be inclusive and the column end to be exclusive? A: This means that when looking for the min value, you should consider the column start but not column end. For example, if my column start was 2 and my column end was 5, I would consider columns 2,3, and 4, but not 5. Q: Why am I failing crabster but passing dog and horses?A: Crabster tends to catch more edge cases. Be sure that in all cases you're checking the correct columns when you compute the energy, cost, and seam.. Q: One of my processing test is failing, but when I print out the output it matches the correct file. A: Double check your image init. If you read in the correct image incorrectly, then Image_equal will fail even if you've processed the image correctly.. . Q: I am missing some test cases. What other tests should I write to catch the test cases?. A: Sorry! We don't share what test cases the AG is looking for. The best advice we can give it to brainstorm more edge cases.¬†. . Q: I'm trying to run processing_public_test.cpp/resize.cpp on XCode, and Xcode is saying that it's unable to open dog.ppm/crabster.ppm/horses.ppm.. A: You need to update XCode's custom working directory: https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_xcode.html#run. Happy coding!. getyourcovidvaccpinations"|793|2|active|||2
