lg0z9cl75s64uy|Final exam topics|What will the final cover?|145|1|active|I believe lectures 11-22 explicitly, but the exam will assume previous knowledge from material from the first midterm!||0
lfvwc8ud8pu7mm|Exam date change|I realized that the eecs 280 exam clashes with another exam I have. Is there an alternate date?
