le2a4i8th04l5|euchre_test01 explanation|To help debug your euchre program (specifically euchre_test01), we have provided an explanation for  each players decision making in each hand.. . Helpful Tips:. 1. If your player is playing or leading the wrong card, take a look at the play_card function, specifically how you compare cards and consider trump.. 2. If your player has the wrong cards in their hand, take a look at the shuffle function in pack.. 3. If your player is calling up trump when it they aren't suppose to (or vice versa), take a look at the card classification functions in Card.cpp (is_trump, is_face_or_ace, is_right_bower, is_left_bower).. 4. Make sure you ALWAYS account for the left bower. It is considered a trump suit not it's original suit. Ex: if hearts was trump, the J of Diamonds is considered a heart not a diamond.. . You can find the explanation in the publicEECS280 drive or by clicking this link.|938|5|active|||1
lds3fpnyi9i7jk|P3 FAQ|"P3 Overview. Slides. Recording. . Euchre Rules. Q: I’ve never played Euchre before, how do I learn the rules of the game?. . A1: Spec: EECS 280 Euchre Rules. . A2: Slides: Welcome to Euchre Afternoon. . A3: YouTube: How to Play EECS 280 Euchre with Simple Players. . Q: How come the left bower was played when the led suit is trump? Why didn’t the left bower follow suit?. . The left bower is always considered the trump suit! Let’s say trump is hearts. That means the left bower is the jack of diamonds. If the led suit is diamonds, playing the jack of diamonds DOES NOT follow suit because the left bower is considered the trump suit (aka hearts). If the led suit is hearts, playing the jack of diamonds DOES follow suit because the left bower is considered the trump suit (aka hearts).. Card.cpp. Pack.cpp. Q: Why won’t pack.in open in pack public tests when running on Xcode?. . Click on the name of your scheme in the toolbar at the top left, Edit Scheme > Options > Enable “Custom Working Directory” and press the little folder icon. Pick the folder that contains your code along with pack.in. This will ensure that the file is visible to your executable. This is usually not a problem, and we are investigating the issue.. Player.cpp. Q: Can I add helper functions while implementing the Player classes?. . You are allowed to use helper functions, but these helper functions should not change the interface of the class. So within your implementations of the class’s member functions, feel free to call helpers. But in your test files, you should not assume that these functions exist (because you should not alter the interface for the classes). This also applies in your euchre driver as well! e.g. If you add a helper function to the simple player class, you can use it within that class, but you can’t use it in the driver since it won’t be part of the Player interface!. . This is especially important because when we run your test cases against an intentionally buggy solution, that solution will not have your specially defined helper functions! So just use the interfaces of each class when you test them.. . Q: Do I need to worry about the human player doing (insert illegal move) during the game?. . No, in accordance with the spec you can assume that a human player will follow the rules of the game and will not attempt to cheat.. . Q: Why am I getting a compiler error for calling sort?. . Note that the sort function modifies the hand. You cannot modify member variables in a const function, so you’ll receive a compiler error you call sort in a const member function.. . You shouldn’t need to sort using card less. When you print the hand in order it should be sorted using the < operator. You could sort with card less when determining what action to take, but you should be able to find the min/max card in the hand without sorting. You could use a functor to sort using card less, but those are only covered later in the course. Generally: if you need to use sort, just the default one will be fine.. . Q: I keep getting an error: “error: creating array of ‘Player’, which is an abstract class type"" or error: creating vector of ‘Player’, which is an abstract class type” or “Allocating an object of abstract class type Player” or “Allocating an object of abstract class to type Simple”…what does it mean?. . Player is an abstract class because it has at least one pure virtual function (see https://eecs280staff.github.io/notes/10_Polymorphism.html#abstract-classes-and-interfaces for a detailed description). You cannot create an object of an abstract class so you may not create a Player object. If you haven’t implemented all the player class functions in simple and human player, you also cannot create a simple or human player object because the simple and human classes inherit the pure virtual function.. . If you are getting the error on a line where you create a Simple or Human player, go back and ensure you coded each of the required functions. If you are getting the error on a line where you create a Player, think of another way to code the function. There are no instances where you should be creating a Player because none of it;s functions are implemented. Note: you are able to create a Player* that points to either a Simple or Human player. This is because you are not actually creating a Player object, you are actually creating a Simple or Human player object.. euchre.cpp. Q: Why am I passing euchre public test, but failing euchre public test with solution card, pack, and player?. . This means that when your euchre.cpp is run with the instructor solution implementations of card, pack, and player you produce incorrect output. This likely means that you’re making an incorrect assumption about what functionality should go in card/pack/player versus in the game of euchre. For example, make sure that you’re not printing output in player.cpp that should be printed in euchre.cpp.. "|1065|2|active|||0

Unfortunately, we don't accept regrade requests after the deadline. A regrade request gives us a second chance to look at your answer more closely with a fresh mind, so it is unlikely that there is still a mistake.

lfao312s5qd4m|Getting points back for a whitespace error in euchre.cpp|Hello, I was wondering if there was any way to get any points back for the euchre project. We had mistakes in Card.cpp and Player.cpp therefore it was really hard to test euchre.cpp, however I think we wrote that file correctly other than one white space error (we outputted the hand number a line too high). Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the euchre tests with solution card, pack, and player are using working versions of these files and therefore are only testing euchre.cpp. We did not pass any of these tests (presumably because of the whitespace error) and we were wondering if there is anyway to get some of these points back as if that was the only mistake we made it was very insignificant. It seems unfair that such a small error would cause us to loose 18 points and make our grade significantly lower. I completely understand if there is no way to get points back but I thought I'd ask.

lf3ddhkvca91ws|Project 3 autograder|Hello,. . I submitted an admin request about this, but the final submission my partner and I made on the Autograder for Project 3 does not correctly reflect what we intended to submit. . . We were trying to save our submissions until we were sure that our own compilers were producing the correct results,. . We didn't realize that the Autograder would place a very long queue when we made our submissions attempts today, resulting in us rushing our submissions and the Autograder taking a very long time to process our submissions. So therefore, our last submission does not properly reflect what we intended to submit.. . So, we wanted to ask if it was possible that our submission that we made on March 10 at 7:27pm (53/69) or the submission made on February 23 (56/69) be graded instead? Whatever the higher score is, can we keep that one?. . Uniqnames: chenww, nwweaver. . Thank you very much.|8|0|private|The score that will be used will be the highest overall score across all of your submissions (with both public and private tests).. .

lf33dtz5zt83j9|euchre_test01 question|Hi, when ordering up on the first hand (hand 0) of euchre_test01, the upcard is the Nine of Hearts which causes Fran to order up hearts on round 1. Fran's hand before ordering up is the King of Clubs, Jack of Hearts, Nine of Spades, Ace of Hearts, and Queen of Spades. Wouldn't ordering up likewise cause Fran to pick up the Nine of Hearts and discard the Nine of Spades as it is resultantly the lowest card in her hand (since the trump suit is now hearts)? In the public test, Fran ends up discarding the upcard while keeping the Nine of Spades and ultimately plays it in one of the upcoming tricks.

levz5we87ph6cx|Simple player play_card not working as expected|Hey team! I've been really stuck on one certain bug when playing a trick with all simple players, specifically test 00. In the third trick of the first (and only) hand of the game, Dabbala . . Initially:. . On the third trick, the lead card is Ten of Diamonds lead by Adi (correct). By the third trick, Dabbala's hand:. . By the rules of simplePlayer, Dabbala should play Nine of Hearts since it is the lowest card AND she has no cards that can follow suit. For some reason, the correct output is Dabbala playing Queen of Clubs, even though it is higher than Nine of Hearts (this is where my confusion lies). This is the output for said third trick. . . Could it have to do with hearts being trump... so it's technically not the lowest card...?. Note that I compared the hand that Dabbala got from dealing to the cards she played in the correct output, and her hand is initially correct. Secondly, note that this is where the first discrepency happens between my output and the correct output, so all tricks have been as expected before this issue. |112|0|active|Resolved (hearts is trump)||0
levwrpna2b37f9|Autograder solution|Hi, now that autograder is back up, my code passes all tests except euchre_test50 with Solution. I heard that the issue with passing by myself but failing the solution is probably that I print something in player that is supposed to be printed in euchre, but I'm having trouble finding this. It hurts that the autograder does not tell me what part of the output is wrong since it uses solution code. . . Since it is test50, I know that it is an error with the HumanPlayer output (the other 2 use simpleplayer). In this class, my outputs are only to prompt the user for input in make_trump, add_and_discard, lead_card, play_card.

leuzjakeyyp506|Trying to debug shuffle|"Hello,. . My partner and I are debugging shuffle. It works for euchre test 00, but we seem to be a card off in euchre test 01. This problem persists and worsens each hand. We wrote out how each card should move after each of the 7 shuffles in ""shuffle"", and want to confirm we are doing it correctly. Our problem for hand 0, which we use as a reference to check our work, is that Edsger is meant to receive a 9 of Hearts, but instead he receives a 10 of Diamonds. Pack.in has the 10 of diamonds at index 19 and our shuffle function should (as we understand it) move it to index 9, where Edsger is draws it from. The 9 of Hearts starts at index  6 and moves to index 20. However, Edsger is supposed to have it in his hand?  We are confused and are having a difficult time finding our bug. Attached is the diagram of how we think the indices are supposed to change after each shuffle (we went through 7). Any help would be greatly appreciated. . . Thank you! . . .

Thanks|98|0|active|"Here are my go to strategies to have better style. . . 1. Try breaking your function up into sections. Can you create a (or a few) helper functions to call inside the function. This would make the function shorter because a bulk of the code will be taken out and it can also get rid of some deep nesting. Lets say if you had 4 nested and you put 2 in the helper function. This would mean we have a deep nesting of 2 and 2 which passes.. . 2. I also try to think about simplifying/combining if/else statements. Especially in this project we have a lot of ""if this then do this"" logic so simplifying can make your code shorter and potentially less nested. Make a list of all the possible outcomes and what would result in each outcome (find overlap in the cases!). .

I would recommend writing additional tests for the add_and_discard function itself to ensure it's truly adding the upcard to the dealer's hand when appropriate.

(may be a bit long, please forgive me). . - Would we have to derive two instances of the game driver to account how the game will run if we have simple players and how the game will run if we have human players?. . - If so, or somewhat along those lines, should we pass in a parameter that indicates that all players are either human or player? My point in doing this is to pass in their argument so then I can hard-code in my implementation: . - Ex: If argument given to function is ""Human"", execute only printing who won the trick and not the other players and what card they play like Player does. . . - To distinguish which functions from Player.cpp need to be called, would we also utilize putting (Human::) or (Player::) by the functions we need to indicate to the compiler which ones to use?. . Mini-Question: I basically created a .h file with RME's to help GSI/Professors/Peers understand my code and how my functions work/their sole purpose. Would this run into any error since I've created it for my driver?"|187|0|active|". Would we have to derive two instances of the game driver to account how the game will run if we have simple players and how the game will run if we have human players?. . No, the game should run the same (same functions will be called for each player). Differences in how players act are handled within the player functions.. . .  If so, or somewhat along those lines, should we pass in a parameter that indicates that all players are either human or player? My point in doing this is to pass in their argument so then I can hard-code in my implementation:. Ex: If argument given to function is ""Human"", execute only printing who won the trick and not the other players and what card they play like Player does. . . Since the previous answer is no, this doesn't really require an answer. However, note that a game can be played with both human and simple players. It is not required that all players are human / all players are simple. Also, printing should be handled inside the human player functions.. . . To distinguish which functions from Player.cpp need to be called, would we also utilize putting (Human::) or (Player::) by the functions we need to indicate to the compiler which ones to use?. . No. You are calling the functions on an object, so you would just call functions normally (if player1 is a pointer, then player1->function() and if player1 is a value then player1.function()).. . . Mini-Question: I basically created a .h file with RME's to help GSI/Professors/Peers understand my code and how my functions work/their sole purpose. Would this run into any error since I've created it for my driver?. . You cannot submit the .h file, so this is an issue. You should only be editing files which you are submitting, because edits made in other files / new files created will be completely ignored by the autograder. This is unless you want to just have like a cpp file for testing, like Pack_tests.cpp - you can still implement that since it will test your code, and does not affect anything."||1

That is, only add and erase card when make_trump is true.Thanks|160|0|active|make_trump returning true does not indicate whether you are in round 1 or 2. It will return true whenever the player wishes to make trump (i.e. if they say yes to the upcard I round one or if they choose a suit in round 2).Also, you cannot call add_and_discard inside of make_trump because make_trump is const.What you need to do is just return true/false in make_trump based on whether or not the player makes trump, and then in euchre.cpp, you can check if it's round 1 or 2.

One strategy would be to make variables to keep track of who is playing, starting with the leader, and keep a vector of cards played in a round. When a round starts, the leader will play a lead card and add this to the vector. From there, iterate through the remaining players and have them each play a card. Finally, determine what card was the highest. Winner then becomes the leader, and you would do this 4 more times, keeping track of who won more tricks. You will also have to add to the total scores at the end of this.. .

lef14t2v4pv1k8|copying a pack|Is it possible to write pack1 = pack2. . where both pack1 and pack2 are Packs.. Would this cause every card in pack1 to equal every card in pack2, or is there another way we would have to go about setting one pack equal to another pack?|69|0|active|This works, you can set one instance of a class equal to another instance of the same class and it will copy over all member variables as well.. . Additionally, since Pack uses a C++ `std::array` for the cards, when that's copied over it will automatically copy the cards as well. This is in contrast to a C-style array, with which you would have to copy the cards yourself with a for-loop, for example. But with a C++ array it does it for you :)||0

leekgbubai04en|Adding and discarding after Making Round 2, trump suit does not match upcard suit.|The function SimplePlayer::add_and_discard() in Player.cpp, to my understanding, should add the upcard to the cards that a simple player is holding, judge which card is the least valuable, and remove the least valuable card.. . In the context of euchre.cpp, this function is called after the trump suit has been made. If the trump suit was made before round two of making, then some player must have ordered up the suit of the upcard, meaning that the trump suit will be the suit of the upcard. Now, the dealer must add the upcard to their hand and discard the card of least value. The value of the cards in their hand is judged in the context of a trump suit existing---that trump suit being the same suit of the upcard. This is works great.. . I am running into a dead end when considering how to evaluate the value of the cards in the dealer's hand when the trump suit is determined in round two of making, i.e. when the made trump suit is not the suit of the upcard. Inside the scope of SimplePlayer::add_and_discard(), only the upcard is passed in. Where previously we could assume that the suit of the upcard is the trump suit and judge the value of the cards based on that, we can no longer do so, as the trump suit that has been decided and is something different, presumable the next suit of the same color.. . How, then, should I resolve this issue? I could make a global suit type object to represent the current trump suit and call Card_less() inside of add_and_discard() using the global suit in place of the trump suit. I could change the parameters of add_and_discard() to include a suit object and pass in the trump suit that is decided in the scope of make_trump(), but I don't want to run into issues with the autograder. I can't write an alternative function because there will be no precedent to override in Player.h.. .

leecfnmx5926yf|game::make_trump()|I was wondering how different is the make_trump in game from the one in player. I understand that it is void and we probably have to check for each player to see if they want to make trump, starting with the one from the left of the dealer. But, I'm not sure how to go about it. Since it's void, should we pass a player parameter and if a player decides to make trump, we set it to the player?. . I was also confused about making trump in round 2. I know for round 1, the 21st card is the up_card. But if they all pass the first time, do we check the 22nd card? I am not quite sure about this part. . . Any help would be appreciated. |129|0|active|The functions given for the Game ADT are merely suggestions. You can change the parameters and types of the functions.

The Player `make_trump` function takes in a round number as input, so just putting in the right number there will handle what suit the player is considering, assuming it's done correctly in the Player `make_trump`.. .

ledexhrnfz1dn|SimplePlayer play_card strategy confusion|I'm a little confused about the SimplePlayer strategy for the play_card function. Say a simple player has an Ace of Diamonds, Ace of Clubs, Jack of Spades, Ten of Spades, King of Spades, and a Ten of Clubs in their hand. Trump is Clubs and the suit of the led card is Clubs. Clubs is trump, so the Jack of Spades is left bower. Since the led suit is Clubs, would a simple player play the Jack of Spades (since it is kind of Clubs due to it being left bower) or the Ace of Clubs, since it is directly Clubs?. . Thank you.|126|0|active|They will play Jack of Spades. For game purposes, left bower is considered to be of trump suit. . . Side note: max card per hand is 5||0

leddyh9jkvf1fm|Segmentation fault in euchre.cpp, not sure where|I am getting a segmentation fault here, not sure where it would occur.. |8|0|private|It's hard to tell exactly what the problem is by looking at a picture.. The general strategy is: whenever you have no idea where the problem is, set a breakpoint at the very beginning of your main function(since this is where your program starts running) and step through your code. Once you hit a segfault, the program will halt and you know where the error occurs. And as to what causes this error, you could progressively move the starting breakpoint from the beginning to the line of failure, each time making sure a small region of code works fine and narrowing down the buggy region.||0

ledbkypaxidft|Confused on player.cpp functions|I tried reviewing the lecture notes on derived classes and polymorphism, the p3 specs and piazza posts but I am still confused. For the derived player classes (simple and human), are we supposed to implement each function with Player::, or are we supposed to be each function declaration in both derived classses, and then implement them with SimplePlayer:: and HumanPlayer::. Doing player:: and not having to put the function declaration in both derived classes makes more sense (because you would just be writing the functions the same way for both classes), but I saw some piazza posts that confuse me if that is true. Thanks!. |115|0|active|You should not implement any function in the Player class as it is an abstract class and is only meant to be derived from.. . You should be creating a HumanPlayer and SimplePlayer class, both of which derive from the Player class. Then, for both SimplePlayer and HumanPlayer, you must at least implement all of the functions that are outlined in Player (because we derive from Player, and Player is an abstract class so we must implement all of them). You can add more functions if you see a need for them, but it's not required.||1
ledbbhrorq376o|euchre_test01: Autograder correct output questions|Why does Fran play the nine of diamonds first in this hand when she has a ten of spades? Shouldn't she be playing the ten of spades first since it is lower than the nine of diamonds (because diamonds is trump here).. |116|0|active|I also made this mistake recently. Yes diamonds is the trump suit. This makes Jack of Hearts the left bower which is also a diamond. Thus, in Line 67 when Edsger leads Jack of hearts, the lead suit for that trick is actually diamonds, so Fran can follow suit, so she should play her Diamonds.||0

If you have the second probably looking at my code in the autograder is better to understand what is happening than me sharing it here.. . Thanks!!|7|0|private|You should use cout statements in your game class. I believe you are referring to input and output redirection, meaning that you can call your euchre game like . . ```. ./euchre.exe pack.in noshuffle 3 Ivan Human Judea Human Kunle Human Liskov Human  euchre_test50.out. ```. . This will use the `euchre_test50.in` file as the input for your game automatically and then output everything to the `euchre_test50.out` file (it will create the file if it doesn't already exist).

led7cd0w76f37b|Is this a typo?|. Can someone explain to me how this is right? It's from the test01 correct output. At this point in the round, the trump suit is Diamonds, and Fran has two cards left, the Ten of Spades and the Nine of Diamonds. Edsger leads with Hearts, and since Fran doesn't have any hearts, as a simple player, she's supposed to play the lowest card in her hand. However, in the correct output, she plays her Diamonds card, which automatically trumps her Ten of Spades even though its number is lower.|172|1|active|Even though it looks like Edsger leads with hearts, because it is the Jack of Hearts it's the left bower, and the left bower is *always treated* as if it were the suit of the same color (in this case Diamonds). So the led suit is actually Diamonds, and because of that Fran must follow suit with the Nine of Diamonds. This is a tricky one so let me know if you have questions!||0

However, it works on my partner's computer. We've checked and the code is the same. Any tips?. . Thanks|135|0|active|Take a look at the lecture notes, but when implementing a virtual function you don't write virtual, and before the curly bracket of the function you need to write override.

Here, Fran has the card{(Q,C), (J,C), (K,S), (N,D), (T,S)}. The trump card is Diamond, the lead suit in 3rd trick is Hearts. The card is the same on my side as well as in the correct version. However, when we go to the 4th trick, something happens. In my logic, Fran should play (T, S), because (Ten of Spades) is less than (Nine of Diamond), because the Diamond is the trump card, so I need to play (T,S). However, the correct version play the (N,D), I do not know why. Just to note, everything same before line 68. Here is the picture: . . For the euchre01.real.out is my version, for the euchre_test01.out.correct is the test case you give us. If you do not think my fran hand holds the right card, you could compare each trick that Fran play except for the last two tricks.

I've submitted my code to auto grader. Please help me because I don't wanna be stuck on it for a weekend. Thank you in advance!!|256|0|active|To test add and discard, I would run the add and discard function, then run play_card 5 times and assert that each card played matches what you expect to see. If your add and discard function is wrong, then one of the play_card calls will return the wrong card.||1

My guess is that at the end of the round, the ""discard pile"" would then be set to the deck, which would be shuffled and then used in the next round, but the euchre_test_out files lead me to believe that there's a specific order that should be followed in order to achieve the desired result. In manual playing of the game, this order doesn't really matter since we're human and the cards are essentially shuffled at the beginning of each game and shuffled in between, but it seems to me that order matters in the test cases and auto-grader.... .

le2xhni4bcn7bu|Simple Player Strategy|Quick question about the simple player strategy… so if the simple player has no cards of the led suit in their hand, they will play the lowest possible card even if that card is the trump suit? - for instance, if hearts is led and spades is trump & the simple player has no hearts but has a nine of spades and a nine of diamonds in their hand, the simple player should play the nine of spades because it is the lowest possible card — Even though the 9 of spades is of the trump suit it is not taken into consideration? |150|0|active|No, the 9 of diamonds will be played since the spades is the trump suit. This means that in the context of this hand, any card that is a spade will be automatically higher than cards with any other suits. Therefore, in this hand, the nine of spades will be higher than the nine of diamonds. Since the player has a lower card in their hand, the nine of diamonds, the simple player will play this card when given the choice between them.||1

Thanks!|216|1|active|When you say populates pack.cards correctly what exactly do you mean? Is it creating a full deck with 52 cards or only 9-A. Without seeing your code, my guess is you need to rethink your logic on incrementing next. You want to return the card at index next and then increment it. Remember that doing ++next will increment next then do ALL operations on the line. Doing next++ will do ALL operations on the line and then increment next. . . In regards to the follow up, deal_one only deals the card at the 'top' of the deck (aka index 0), then marks that card as dealt by incrementing next. That means next acts as a reference to the top card index, which is why we have to increment it after returning the top card. When a deck is shuffled, we have no idea what cards are where and we can't go based off rank or suit. ||1

le1roeutl9l1hh|Sort deck issue|Hi I'm trying to use the sort function to sort my hand before printing, but whenever I do I get all of these errors. How can I fix this?. . |292|1|active|"I ran into this issue myself, and had to do a bit of Googling to figure out what the issue was.. . So, it turns out that the ""const"" modifier after the member function declaration (the ""const"" in ""void print_hand() const"", for example) essentially tells the compiler that the member function DOES NOT modify any of the member variables of the class being dealt with.. . Note that ""make_trump"" does not modify any member variables of any of the Player classes, and so is defined as being ""const."" Functions declared as ""const"" can ONLY run other ""const"" functions, as otherwise they could potentially change member variables of the class (which is not allowed by the compiler). This means that ""print_hand"" must also be declared as ""const"".. . The issue here is with the sort function—the sort function DIRECTLY CHANGES one of the member variables of the Player class (the Player's hand, namely), which is illegal. This is where the ""swap"" errors come in, since the swap function is TRYING to alter the ""hand"" variable of the Player class, but due to the ""const"" definition, this is illegal.. . To fix the issue, we CANNOT alter any of the member variables of the Player class in any way. The easiest way to solve this problem, therefore, is to simply create a COPY of the Player's hand, and then sort and print the COPY. This way, we aren't actually altering any member variables of the class.. . This is the way I understood it, feel free to correct me if I'm mistaken.. .

Hello, for one of the player tests, my partner and I are testing add and discard by having two hands; one hand has a card that is added and discarded and the other hand does not have any cards added and discarded, however we are making the hands / add and discard so that the played card should be the same for both. . . . I believe this test was noted as valid in Autograder (when I removed the test the score went from 16/17 to 14/17) however the issue is that we delete the first player after making their hand so later on when we do ASSERT_EQUAL for the played card in the first and second player, there is an out of bound error (it works locally but does not work in autograder). . How would we resolve this / make a change to avoid an out of bounds error (not sure how to do this). If we just delete the two players at the end of the test that is causing an issue. I have attached the test below for your reference.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Player * bob = Player_factory(""Bob"", ""Simple"");. bob->add_card(Card(NINE, SPADES));. bob->add_card(Card(NINE, CLUBS));. bob->add_card(Card(QUEEN, SPADES));. bob->add_card(Card(ACE, SPADES));. bob->add_card(Card(KING, SPADES));. . . Card lead_card = bob->lead_card(SPADES);. . ASSERT_EQUAL(lead_card, Card(NINE,CLUBS));. . delete bob;. . Player * correct = Player_factory(""Correct"", ""Simple"");. correct->add_card(Card(JACK, SPADES));. correct->add_card(Card(NINE, CLUBS));. correct->add_card(Card(QUEEN, SPADES));. correct->add_card(Card(ACE, SPADES));. correct->add_card(Card(KING, SPADES));. . . correct->add_and_discard(. Card(NINE, HEARTS) // upcard. );. . Card lead_card2 = bob->lead_card(SPADES);. ASSERT_EQUAL(lead_card2, Card(NINE,HEARTS));. . // Verify the card Bob played. ASSERT_EQUAL(bob, correct);. . delete correct;. "|6|0|private|I don't think you should be comparing the bob and correct pointers if you're trying to make sure they have the same cards in their hands. One option is to make two vectors, have each player play all their cards and put their cards into one of the two vectors, sort the two vectors, then assert that the vectors are equal.||0

le0w8erwrjh3dj|Pack Public Test string to rank assert|I was running the debugger through my Pack input stream constructor because I was running into an assert(false) in the string_to_rank() function. I have a while loop for my pack constructor which runs:. while (pack_input >> card) . The issue occurs when after reading in the last card from the file, my >> operator reads pack_input and passes an empty string into string_to_rank which triggers the assert.. . Is this because my while loop isn't conditioned properly or because there's an issue in my >> operator?|169|0|active|The followup is good advice. If that doesn't work, another solution is to change it to a `for` loop that loops `PACK_SIZE` times, since the file is guaranteed to have that number of cards.||1
le0vfyd2em6493|Simple Player: Making Trump round 2|Hi! When making trump for Simple Player in round 2, what happens if there are 1 or more cards in both the trump suit and the other suit of the same color? For example, if the trump suit is Heart, and the player has 1 or more face/ace Heart card and 1 or more face/ace Diamond card. Would the order_up_suit go to the suit that has more cards?|207|1|active|"When making trump, there is no trump suit yet. The point of making trump is to decide the suit of trump. It seems like you don't fully understand the making trump process, so let me explain before answering your question:. . During round 1, after cards are dealed, the next card in the deck, the ""upcard"" is flipped up, and this is a ""potential trump"". You go around, starting with the person after the dealer, asking if anyone wants to make this suit the trump suit, and everyone says yes or no. If someone says yes, the suit of the upcard becomes the trump suit, and the dealer picks up the upcard and discards a card. If all four people say no, the upcard is flipped back over (or at least, in a physical game of euchre).. . During the second round, you go around, again starting with the person after the dealer, asking if anyone wants to choose the trump suit (they can choose any suit now, not just say yes/no to the suit of the upcard). If someone chooses, the suit that they choose becomes the trump suit. If no one chooses, the dealer is forced to choose.. . The ""trump"" suit does not really exist in round 2, so it doesn't need to be considered. Also, only considering the ""Next Suit"" (other suit of same color), is not a real strategy used in euchre, it is just done to make the simpleplayer easier to code. In a real game you would just consider if you have a strong enough hand under some trump to choose that trump. (There is a disadvantage to being the one to choose the trump suit, I can explain in followup discussions if you're curious).. . Now, onto your question:. . In your example, I assume that you meant that Heart was the suit of the upcard. You do not need to consider this suit at all. Just consider the next suit, diamonds, following the rule given in the spec. If the player has one or more face or ace diamond, then make the trump suit diamonds, and if not, then you pass.. . Hope that helped!"||1

le0jwryhf905ik|Overload Operator Question|I have a conceptual question. For the std::istream & operator>>(std::istream &is, Card &card) function, I read in another post that we're supposed to return the is object at the end of the function. What's the point of doing this? I thought the purpose of this specific function was to take in input and fill a card accordingly. Why isn't this function void then? Or is it not possible for it to be void?|141|1|active|"Returning a reference to the input/output stream allows us to chain multiple objects together.. Take the insertion operator as an example.. int a = 3;. int b = 4;. cout << ""a is "" << a << "", b is "" << b << endl;. This is able to print a is 3, b is 4 because the insertion operator returns a reference to the output stream. Otherwise, it would fail after the first insertion since for the second insertion operator, you are passing in a void(the return of cout << ""a is "") and an int(a), which does not match the parameter types of the function.. . In our case, we want to chain input/output, so we can read in a rank and a suit on one line, for example. That's why we overload the operators with return types."||0

le0i9f7x6hb2gs|Card_Less with trump|I'm finding my card_less functions are starting to get very long since the only way I can think to approach it is by checking every possible combination of cards (I.e. trump and not trump, both non trump, both trump) and when both cards are trump I have to check for both bowers, and the if-elses are really piling up.  Is there meant to be a simpler way to write this function other than just brute force checking or will lengthy if else statements like this suffice?|140|0|active|"The way I approached it was quite similar; if A was a trump and B was not, A would never be less than B, and vice-versa.If both were trump, you really only need to worry about whether A or B (or both) are one of the bower cards, since if neither are a bower card the normal ""<"" operator will suffice.Same goes if neither of the cards are of the trump suit; you can just use ""<"".I ended up with 3 main if statements, and inside the one that checks if both are trump cards, I had 3 more nested conditionals.

Then, see what is true about the cards if they don't enter an if statement. ||1
ldreibqhra01ur|Segmentation Fault in &lt;&lt; operator implementation|Hello, my implementation of the << operator in cards.cpp is causing a segmentation fault (I know this is causing the segmentation fault as when I remove the implementation the segmentation fault does not occur).

ldqlmah1c7x2gk|empty() function - How to determine if there are no more cards left in the pack?|While I am trying to implement this function, I am confused by the Effects addressed in the header file. Could anyone plz give me some clue on how to determine if the Pack is empty? Thanks in advance!|236|0|active|Think about the private member variables contained in Pack.

I'm using the scope resolution operator. If anyone can point me in the right direction, that would be greatly appreciated!|247|0|active|For the first error, you should switch the position of the Card and Rank around the scope resolution pointer. Same for the last error. I think the note is not an error but a reminder.. . Just to clarify, when you write the class member functions, you should remember that the return type is always put in front of the class name.||1

ldqdy7iqlz6fz|get_suit(Suit trump)|Do we return the left bower here or is trump THE suit of the left bower.

ldqby6deatt6tz|get_suit(suit trump) const quesiton|the hint in the RME says that the left bower is the trump suit.. . Does this mean that I will have to return both colors?. .

ldp94fbre2s3nt|Operator == overloading|What is the point of overloading == when we can use the same operator to compare objects directly?|186|0|active|You can only use the == operator to compare objects directly if they are predefined types (say integers or characters). For types you construct yourself, you would need to overload the == operator to give it any meaning for that type. For example, you can use the == operator for strings because the string class defines an == operator which checks if each character of the string is the same.||0
