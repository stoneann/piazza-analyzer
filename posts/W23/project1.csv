lcgm3rz7e4i7dn|Project 1 FAQ|Refer to this post for Frequently Asked Questions regarding the setup tutorial and Project 1.  The setup tutorial itself is linked on the eecs280 website.  Project 1 is due Wednesday, January 18 at 8pm.  Please keep the followups related to questions in this post only.. . Q: I get this error when trying to run VSCode on WSL (error starting the pipe progam):. . A: Try changing:. . “pipeProgram”: “c:\windows\sysnative\bash.exe”,. . to. . “pipeProgram”: “/mnt/c/Windows/System32/bash.exe”,. . in the launch.json. . Q: I’m trying to debug my project with VSCode on Mac, but it’s skipping all my breakpoints. What do I do?. . A: This is a known bug in the Microsoft C/C++ extension. Try installing the `CodeLLDB` extension with the following steps:. . . In VSCode, go to the Extensions tab and search for “CodeLLDB”. . . Set your `launch.json` configuration to the following:. . . { “name”: “(lldb) Launch”,. . “type”: “lldb”,. . “request”: “launch”,. . “program”: “${workspaceFolder}/stats_tests.exe”,. . “args”: [],. . “cwd”: “${workspaceFolder}”,. . }. . Q: VSCode/macOS: Why am I unable to view console output?. . A: Try installing the `CodeLLDB` extension: https://eecs280staff.github.io/tutorials/setup_vscode.html#macos-1. . Q: I haven’t worked with vectors before - are there any recommended resources?. . A: Check out the project 1 vector tutorial https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/vector.html. . Q: My output is not printing out…what might be causing this? I am getting an “Invalid Read” or “Segmentation Fault”…what might be causing this?. . A: This is caused by an “Access-out-of-bounds” error. You are indexing past the valid elements of a vector and reading some unknown data! This is undefined behavior that computers handle differently (which is why this may fail on the autograder but not locally). Re-read your function and think about where it could index out of bounds. Write some test cases that test the bounds of the vector to help you catch the bug!. |1112|1|active|||0

How do I stop this from happening. |88|0|active|"You can set the bounds for your for loop to stop at the second last element. For the last element, you can bring that logic outside the for loop. . . One other idea is that outside of your loop, store the first (0th index element), then inside the loop, check val against your vector and update it as you go. This would help because you don't have to have something such as v[i+1] since you can just compare v[i] to val. Of course, remember that you have to update ""val""!. . // Only for demonstration purposes!

ld27sogwp0g7p|student stats_tests compile check|. is there any way anyone could tell me what this error means?  it is the only thing that fails|97|0|active|Seems like in stats_tests.cpp, you have implementations of functions of stats.cpp. If you have two functions with the same definition (in the same file or across files you've included), c++ would get confused about which one you want to use, so that's why you see that error. . . You want to write test cases for the functions of stats.cpp. Please refer to unit test tutorial on how to write tests (the starter file for stats_tests.cpp can also be helpful).

ld26ant6n146iy|stats.cpp - assert(false) usage question|Hi, so in stats.cpp there are assert(false); statements provided in the starter code, but running it causes assertion to abort. Should we modify these statements to guarantee the non-violation of the RME clauses (such as no empty vectors) or should we do something else with them?

ld23vdjf4bzog|Percentile input (p)|I see that the input for the function percentile is between 0 and 1 inclusive but for the public tests on the autograder, it seems that the inputted p is greater than 0 (ie. 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100) and not between 0 and 1. The autograder is showing the 25th, 50th, 75th, and 100th as 0s and incorrect. Did anyone else have this problem?. . |85|0|active|Think of the 100th percentile being when p is 1, and the 0th percentile being when p is 0. The function only takes in a p value between 0 and 1.||0

ld1w9z1zwjk4hb|Heap overflow|My summary function is working I think, it's just when I print out the summary, it addresses outside of the vector. Is it because my loop runs i < data.size()? |86|0|active|If a loop indexes from 0 to data.size(), everything should be in-bounds since the 1-indexed nth element has index (n - 1), so even the last data.size()-th element has index data.size() - 1.. . The culprit may be that you are accessing index (i + 1) somewhere, and when i = data.size() - 1, data[i] is out of bounds.||0
ld1veguizmf2qt|Grades|I saw that there are no style points for Project 1. Is there anything else we need to be aware of, or does a 9/9 on the Autograder mean 100% on the project?|17|0|private|9/9 on the autograder right now reflects the public test cases. After the deadline we run a set of private test cases on your submission, and those in addition to the public tests determine your final grade for the project. To have the best chances of passing the private test cases you can write your own tests, consider edge cases, and then see if your code passes your own tests.||0
ld1v4zas1x66r1|Mean|Would the mean for an empty vector be zero or undefined?|117|1|active|The RME states that the function Requires a vector that is not empty, so you don’t need to worry about it.However, if we weren't requiring that the vector is not empty: how you implement the mean function (or if you're using a function from package, then how the author of that package implemented it), including the types you are using for your values (doubles, integers, etc.) will influence how the compiler handles it. In our case, it would probably be a division of two double zeroes, which would probably result in either INF (positive infinity) or -INF (negative infinity). Here's a good answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4745311/c-division-by-0Writing a good function involves being able to handle any possible input the user could think of or mistakenly put it, because it means our program is robust and easier to use. (One might handle this by checking if the vector is empty and then outputting a message to the user if it is.) But at least in this project, it seems we are just restricting what the user can enter to simplify it for us while we refresh our knowledge of some of the concepts.||0

ld1u1om8p4f4xf|double comparison: const vs #define, abs vs fabs, and how much precision?|I read through what's in spec for comparing doubles. I also looked around for advice, and got conflicting answers.. . assert(abs(x - y) < epsilon). . Even though the scope of #define would be larger than const in this case, wouldn't it be better to use it for epsilon because it's pre-processed before compilation, which seems better for this type of comparison? Will we get marked down for using #define?Should I use abs() or fabs()? fabs() seems to reduce ambiguity b/c it returns a double, but spec uses abs().Spec uses 0.00001 precision for epsilon. I found advice to go far more precise on this (1e-20, aka 0.00000000000000000001) because we're doing simple statistics (and not something like trig). Is there any reason not to go more precise?|99|0|active|- Not a big enough difference to matter here. I don't recommend making code fancier than it needs to be; if you end up going down the wrong track and needing to backtrack, it becomes a waste of time.. - `abs()` with a float / double input will return a double as well. No difference. Read https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/math/fabs carefully.. - Not a big deal for this project, but if you were writing an actual stats library a smaller epsilon makes sense.||0
ld1t4y4uq5f5h2|heap overflow|When I compile my program in Xcode, it reads in the HCMST_ver_3.04.tsv data, but it overflows and the program crashes. |127|0|active|Check that your summarize function is correctly returning a vector of pairs, and that you're iterating through it correctly (I'd reccomend using your debugger for this!)||2

However, while testing my percentile function I get a result of like -14.000000004 which fails assertion when estimated to equal -14. I get a similar value for other test cases for percentile where they have a bunch of trailing zeroes and then a non-zero number but they do not fail assertion. In order to assert these and pass it, would I just have to assert it equal to the division I use? Or would this be more like an integer / double division problem? My implementation for percentile() has been submitted just not the test cases btw.

Does this have something to do with input redirection? I am struggling to wrap my head around that concept. For context, my percentile function does not use cin. Somehow it just works in the terminal (but apparently not on Autograder!).|12|0|private|Converting to private since my response involves specifics of your code. It looks like your main.cpp is inputting percentiles in the range from 0-100, whereas your stats.cpp is expecting it to be from the range 0-1. This could be the cause of your issue.||0

ld15pp6g2v935|Summarize function, out of range|After fixing my summarize function, I decided to run it however, it kept saying vector out of bounds, even though I set a condition for it to end before it even reaches the end. I tried returning it in the else statement, but it was still out of bounds. Then, I tried moving my if statement to before the loop starts, but still, it is out of bounds. I am having difficulty understanding the cause since I am not going to an empty vector or looking at the next position. |7|0|private|From what is visible in the terminal, it seems like the out-of-bounds error is not occurring in your summarize function but in your main driver program that is printing the output vector of pairs of the summarize function.

This answer can also be found in the FAQ post (@6). By a brief look at your code, I can see that there is a logical flaw in your main function.

lcz38esl8iw6k8|linker command error|i keep getting a linker command error, and i'm unsure of how to fix it. any suggestions?|95|0|active|"What kind of linker error is it? The most common one I've seen for P1 is when the linker fails to find a definition for a function that is being called, thus causing an ""undefined symbol"" error. If you're getting this error for any of your stats functions (such as when you run ""make stats_tests.exe"" or ""make stats_public_test.exe""), make sure you have an implementation for all of your functions in stats.cpp (even if they're just stubs for now, like we do here in the spec) so the linker can find a definition for any referenced stats function.. . Another common error is when the linker fails to find a main() function. Your stats_tests.cpp and stats_public_test.cpp already have main functions, and stats.cpp shouldn't have a main function, since it's simply providing an implementation for the stats library to be used by other programs. However, your main.cpp does need a main() function, so if you try to ""make main.exe"" without creating one, you'll get a linker error."||1

I want to ask whether return v.size() in a int function is valid or not. I write my count() function in this way and it seems that everything compiles successfully. |150|0|active|"Quick correction to the student's answer: vector's size() function (along with the size() functions of many other containers in the C++ standard library, which we'll talk more about later this semester) does not return an int, but returns an unsigned integer type; according to the C++ reference, most vector implementations use an std::size_t for this.. . Why not a normal int? This is beyond the scope of 280, but on most computer platforms (such as on your and my laptop), an integer is 32 bits in length, and signed (meaning it can represent negative and positive numbers). This means an int has a range of [-231, 231). Vectors can never have a negative size, so it doesn't make sense for size() to return a signed type. Furthermore, on the 64-bit platforms we support in 280, std::size_t is 64 bits in length. Therefore, by using std::size_t, vectors can (theoretically) contain [0, 264) elements (though your program could exhaust its allowed memory before that happens).. . Your compiler might complain if you try to do something like ""int num_elements = v.size();"" This is because you're casting from a larger type (std::size_t) to a smaller type (int). For example, what if your vector's size is something like 240, which fits in an std::size_t but overflows an int? That implicit cast might do something wonky, like cast to a negative number.. . However, for the sake of P1, you won't be dealing with huge vectors like that, so explicitly casting like so is safe for our purposes: ""int num_elements = (int) v.size();"""||1
lcz1zpxtg4l6wx|Test cases|Should all our test cases for each function be in one function, or should each individual test case have its own function?

Grouping the tests for the same functions into one test function and separating those for different ones makes it easier to track down where errors originate from.. Different answer: I would recommend them being 3 separate functions. For example, I would name them something like ""test_median_simple"", ""test_median_single_value"", etc.. That way, when you run your tests, the output will indicate which specific test function failed. Otherwise, if you had just one function for median tests, and one of the test cases failed, you would have to pay attention to line numbers to figure out which one failed, which is much more work and more prone to mistakes."||0

The main function should only exist in main.cpp, for which instructions are available on the spec.. . Now, going back to mode. In your current code, it seems that at line 17, you have access to a value and its frequency. For the mode, you will need to keep track of the ""maximum frequency so far"" and the respective value.

Thanks in advance!. |154|0|active|Are the arguments you're passing into the debugger through your launch.json the same as the arguments you're passing in on the command line?I ran into a similar issue, and that is most likely due to an unsorted vector when running the percentile calculations (the indices are out of order). Sorting the vector first should solve this.||1

lcsd5ktrd2n3is|Purpose of stats.cpp?|I'm a little confused on the purpose of the stats.cpp file. At the start of the specs, it says to write implementations for all the functions in the stats.cpp file. Then, a little further down the page, it says to add a bunch of function stubs with assertions to the stats.cpp file. Do we add these in addition to the implementations or do we add the stubs to try to compile it and then delete the stubs?|6|0|private|That's right you need to implement all the functions from `stats.h` in `stats.cpp`.

In the context of p1, you are also encouraged to follow this good practice. It is okay to fail part of the tests because you haven't implemented that function yet, but if you fail a test of a function you have completed, then you know there is a problem that needs to be fixed.||0

lcob688nqwv6|where should I write my functions?|I am confused. Where I am I suppose to write my functions at? |147|0|active|You should download the starter file from the project spec. Then, stats.h describes the functions that you should write, and you should implement them in stats.cpp. . The main project spec page has all the shell of where you should write them, that you should paste into the empty stats.cpp file. The stats header is included in the files that actually run the files, so stats.cpp should't have a main() function -- it should just be the code for implementing the stats functions. ||0
lcoahbt6a4x72n|Help with summarize() function|I am struggling to make any progress with this function. Right now the only thing I can think to do is use a for loop to maybe count the number of distinct elements in the vector, then another one to count how many times each distinct element appears.

I was thinking maybe run another for loop to somehow insert the number and how many times it appears that way? Overall just having trouble with this funciton. Any advice as to a better way to think about it would be really appreciated. Thanks!|249|2|active|One piece of advice is to sort the vector, as it might make the problem a bit easier.

I am not sure if it is possible to call another function from stats.cpp and use it in another stats.cpp function since there is no main function in this file and it might be out of scope or something. Also, I thought this may not be allowed because maybe the project guidelines wanted us to build each stats function from scratch (so just calculate the mean again in the stdev function). I just wanted to double check this before doing so to save some work if we were allowed to call another function we had already wrote. Any guidance here would be much appreciated. Thanks!|227|0|active|Thanks for asking to make sure. It is actually good and recommended to use functions inside other functions.

lcmhmd7u5wx4et|I&#39;m failing my own test cases even though the output looks identical to me|So I was writing test cases for the stdev function in stats.cpp, and I'm pretty sure I wrote the function correctly, but I'm failing my own test cases. This is the test case that I was using.. . The output from the stdev and the sqrt are given below. . . I thought that the issue would be with the casting of the numbers, so just to be safe I casted both of them to double, but I still failed the assertion as you can see. I'm assuming that this has to do with how the number is actually represented in the memory of the computer, as in, the number that I'm calculating is something like 465.2250000001 and the number that the sqrt gives out is 465.22500000002 which is why I'm failing the assertion. I wanted to know if there's any way to fix this.. For reference, I've posted the code in my stdev function below.. . |8|0|private|What you've put in the followup is the answer.

So far I believe I have written all my code such that it should with or without negative numbers (i.e. my test cases include both positive and negative doubles and there seems to be no issues). That said, for the minimum function I feel like it is important to know for certain whether negative numbers are actually able to be included as data points (or whether 0 is the minimum possible value).

You can't assume there won't be negatives. That means you can't use 0 as the minimum possible value. You can use the first element as the vector as a starting min value because it ensures that your min is at least something in the vector.

The reason we show you how to run the program using your terminal is for two reasons:. . 1. you may need to in future classes, so should at least be familiar. 2. you need to use the terminal to upload your code to CAEN.

This can help you deduce if the function is incorrect or if the test case is faulty (if you created the vector wrong and 2 actually isn't the mode).. . 2. If the problem is not with the test case, then use print statements or your visual debugger to figure out the bug inside the function.

From where?Thank you|208|0|active|If you look at the declaration for `summarize()` in `stats.h`, the comments there give you a very good explanation of what the function is meant to do. Basically, the function is meant to count the number of times each distinct value appears in a vector.. . For example, if you have the vector `{1.0, 4.0, 4.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.0, 9.0}`, the resulting vector of pairs from `summarize()` would look like:. .  ```. {.   {1.0, 1},.   {4.0, 2},.   {7.0, 3},.   {9.0, 1}. }. ```. . This is because the numbers 1.0, 4.0, 7.0, and 9.0 occurred once, twice, three times, and once, respectively. Note that the *values* (the first part of the pairs) are sorted in the result.||0

This compiled without any problems for me and the functions I used it in returned the correct output, so would it be ok to leave it like this? Or should int i be changed to size_t i ?|167|0|active|Strictly speaking, the return type of `vector::size` is `size_t`, so for complete, impeccable type compatibility, `size_t i` is best. A common caveat of doing this is that `i` can now no longer be negative, so for example, the condition `i >= 0` would always be true. This can trip you up when you want to iterate through a container from back to front using indices, as in `for (size_t i = v.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) ...`, which is incorrect.. . I noticed that you didn't initialize `i` to a determinate value. Your machine or compiler might happen to set it to 0 when this happens, but technically `i`'s value is undefined. You should write `size_t i = 0; ...` instead to ensure that it is set to 0. _This kind of unpredictable behavior might get caught by the undefined behavior sanitizer on the autograder._||0

lcjhzedr4rr5br|Multiple outputs for mode|In the given stats.cpp file, the mode has a double return type. However, modes have the potential for multiple outputs.

lcjhd1g53jy3ul|Issue downloading starter files|Hi, I’m currently using a windows computer and whenever I try to paste the link for starter files in my browser it downloads a .gz file? Whenever I try to click on it the only app I can use to open it is notepad and it just opens cryptic text. Has anyone else encountered/ found a fix for this issue? Let me know. Thanks.|153|0|active|To add onto the student's answer, you can also extract a .tar.gz file with one command: tar -xzf starter-files.tar.gz. This is how we do it in the setup tutorial (we also add the -v option in the tutorial to enable verbose mode so we can see additional information, like the name of every file extracted).||1

How can I fix this?"|148|0|active|If you're compiling within Xcode and not with the command line, make sure you're configuring your build phases properly using this link . You should only have one file with a main function (i.e. stats.cpp) in the build phases at a time, and there are some files that should not be included as compile sources.||1

lcih2w8q36r1rj|Assert Precision|So whats happening in my stats tests cpp file is that when I had a data set and when I calculated the percentile the answer is 61.9, however in the code it is really stored as 61.900000000000006, therefore causing the assert function to fail. Is there some way that I can return my percentile with a control on the decimal places ? Or should I not worry about this ? |288|5|active|You could compare the values to a certain decimal precision (say, 3 decimal places) instead by simply multiplying it by a power of 10 and converting it to an integer (truncating the remaining decimals), like this, for example, with 3 decimal places of precision:. . . #include <cmath>. . void assert_double_equal(double x, double y) {.   assert(trunc(x * 1000) == trunc(y * 1000));. }. ||1
