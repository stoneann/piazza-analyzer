lfx8cbeyvuz7nb|Project 4|Hi. Could someone please take a look at me and my partner's submission for project 4?

lfx2j62nvij4j5|Confused on how I failed so many List Private Test cases|Title, not sure what caused all these private test cases to possibly crash. I went into OH where I had my code looked at and the IA stated that everything seemed to be fine. The only thing I'm a little iffy on is the end() implementation, which I assumed was given to us (since begin was technically given to us), but even then that should only affect iterators.. . uniqname: elghoulh. . The worst part of all is that I had memory sanitizers enabled, so if there were any issues, ideally they should've been caught by test cases.|12|0|private|I took a look at your code and found a problem that could be the reason.. In == and != operators, you compared datum instead of node_ptr to check if two iterators are equal or not. However, two iterators are equal if they point to the same node and not equal otherwise. If two iterators point to the same node, then they always have the same datum, but the reverse is generally not true.. I guess most private test cases use these two operators, even if they are not explicitly testing them, which could be why many test cases didn't pass.. I'm sorry that this happened to you.||2
lfx17iwkdeao4|does autograder take the most recent submission?|So my highest score on the autograder submissions for p4 was a 61/63. My last submission was a 58/63 because of an error I missed. My final score was calculated based on the recent score (58/63). I thought it's always the highest score taken. Is that not the case?|169|1|active|It's possible that your 58/63 submission passed more private tests than your 61/63 submission, leading that to be the final score.||1
lfwumql7cgg256|Why Are There Private Tests For API.cpp When We Don&#39;t Write Test Cases|After the private tests were released, I came to see that all of the private tests for api.cpp failed. I have no clue how this is even possible, or why we are given private tests on something that we aren't even prompted to test, while all of the public tests passed. The point of writing test cases is to make sure that you can catch any bugs that the public tests don't, but how am I supposed to catch bugs for private testing when I am not prompted to write test cases to begin with. Why are we graded on private tests on code that we aren't supposed to test ourselves?. . P.S. I had 63/63 on submission, and everything seemed to worked perfect.|176|14|active|While I agree with your point that writing test cases is to catch bugs, not having the instructors asking you to write and grading those test cases does not prevent you from writing your own private tests to catch bugs. I'm sure this will become more common in ULCS courses as well as in the industry as a software engineer. I understand that you are disappointed with your api.cpp private test score, but I do not believe it is the instructor's issue here, since it did not prevent you from testing it yourself to make sure you have working code. In addition, Autograder did disclose it would run private tests on api.cpp, so this wasn't really a surprise.. ||1
lfwsnv5ac721aj|List test insert 3 private test|My list test insert 3 private test failed and I have been trying to figure out why. I have not been able to write a test case where my insert function fails. Is there anything obviously wrong with my insert function? Thank you so much.. . |10|0|private|"Consider what happens if we want to insert a node at the end of the list, and thus pass in an iterator returned from List::end() (we want to insert before the iterator, which is currently at one past the end, so we're effectively inserting at the end). Thus, the iterator's node pointer is nullptr. This is a valid input, as the iterator passed in must simply be a ""valid iterator associated with this list,"" and doesn't have to be dereferencable like in other functions (such as erase()). Does your else{} block handle this input correctly? It looks like it'll try to dereference a nullptr by accessing n->prev."||1
lfw8o9yztxc7i2|Project 4 Grades|I got a 61/63 on the public tests, but when the private tests came back I got an 80%. I don't think it's fair considering there was no way we could test our api other than the autograder and the tests that were provided to us. How would I make sure this doesn't happen again? |275|12|active|For p4. you can write you own private tests by making your own test files by inputting GET, POST, and DELETE requests and seeing what it outputs and see if it matches what the spec wants these requests to do. . . And you should always aim for full score on the autograder to ensure that you get a high score on the private tests.||2
lfw3eyg7cn96vs|Issue with creating entire queue (possible error with adding Students to the queue)|"Hello, . when I'm trying to iterate through the queue list using a for loop, my code never enters the for loop. I tried 3 different for loop conditions, but it still won't work. I think that there may be an error when I add a student to the queue- specifically, I don't think the student 'stays' in the queue.. . I create a student Sonia, of which I enter/assign the location, position, and uniqname, and then do queue.push_back(Sonia). But queue.empty() (after a student was added and I try to add another student) always equals true, meaning that there are no students in the queue. Could someone check my implementation to see why this may be happening?. . I've used the debugger and it skips over the for loop.

lfvw9qd01kz783|api.exe confusion: Lost 12% of overall grade on p4-web API private tests|I was looking over our p4-web grade and was a bit disappointed with the grade I got until I noticed that nearly 12% of our grade was lost in api private tests.. . I have a feeling that all these failed test cases came from not correctly updating the positions of the students after a DELETE request. I thought we had taken care of this in our code but upon review I'm starting to believe that we just flat out missed this.. . Could you confirm if this was indeed the reason we lost 12% of our grade? If so, I feel really really really stupid. I looked over the spec and didn't see any mention of this but it's honestly so obvious that I can't believe I missed it. It also feels a bit harsh and frustrating to lose that many points for something like this if the rest of our implementation was fine.. . Could you advise for better understanding how we could have/should have gone about tracking the position of each student to have avoided this issue? I have the feeling we missed some really obvious method or something that would have easily fixed this. Thanks!|14|0|private|"I've taken a look at your DELETE() function, and it looks like it's missing some logic for looping over the remaining students in the queue, and decrementing their positions. I understand why you feel disappointed with yourself, but remember that a single project (or, more specifically, one requirement from one part of one project) cannot possibly represent your ability or value as a scholar; if you've made ""stupid"" mistakes before, you're certainly in good company. ;). . In terms of potential implementations for this requirement, I recommend using some sort of for loop (either using an iterator, or a for-each loop with references) that accesses each each Student in the queue, and decrements their position member. I prefer for-each loops for tasks like this; they generally look like this:. . for (Student &stu : queue) { // notice stu is a reference!. // do something in here. }. . I'm sorry you didn't get the grade you wanted. On my first attempt of the driver, I completely overlooked the position decrement requirement. I'll pass this feedback on to the rest of the staff so we can clarify this detail in the spec."||1
lfvsj76kmtt2xo|How to talk about p4 with interviewer?|"I got an interview next week and I just want to get some idea how to talk about it with them. Tbh I'm still not sure if I can say ""I build an API"" or something like this. I implemented the list.h but I'm not even using it in api.cpp. What's the best way to describe this project in a tech interview? Would it be better to talk about p3 instead of this one since I totally understand what I'm doing in p3, but for p4 all I can say is ""I'm reading this in and process it and writing this out""."|233|1|active|Just adding my two cents: Remember that you can't really show your interviewer your code (due to likely time constraints and the Honor Code, though we cannot really enforce the latter here), so the specifics of your implementation aren't all that important for impressing your interviewer. In my experience, interviewers are more interested in how you achieved something rather than what you achieved, as well as what you learned from the experience. For example, rather than simply discussing the implementation details of P3 or P4, I'd focus on the software engineering process. These details are typically beyond the scope of EECS 280, but some important things to consider:. Did you work with someone else? If so, how'd you manage the collaboration? If hired, you'll almost certainly be working with other people, so your collaboration and communication skills are vital to your success!How did you plan your implementation before beginning it?How did you go about testing your code?What debugging strategies did you employ?What roadblocks did you encounter along the way, and how did you overcome them?How did you manage your time amidst your busy schedule?After finishing the project(s), what did you learn from the experience? If you had to do the whole project again, what would you do differently? (For example, would you write tests before implementing functions? Use pair-programming with your partner? etc). Regardless of whether you're interviewing for industry positions or not, these learnings can also help you in future EECS projects, too. Best of luck in your interview!||0

lfuolmlshp81do|Unsuppressed cout statement used in final submit (otherwise would match output without it)|I have an unsuppressed cout statement in my delete function that will prevent my output from matching 1:1. This cout statement was used purely for testing purposes on delete and otherwise matches the output when commented out. I didn't intend to use this cout statement in the final version of the code and accidentally left it unsuppressed. Despite this unsuppressed cout statement, I was still passing the public tests for api. This is in line 186 of my final autograder submit on api.exe. I know this might be a shot in the dark, but can anything be done to disregard this or potentially allow another submit to make this change?|12|0|private|I'm sorry, but for fairness reasons we can't do anything here. Your final grade will be based on whichever submission has the highest score, so if you have a previous submission that doesn't have the unsuppressed cout then that'll probably be used instead.||0
lfug0ubhx8t71z|Project 4 Test Style checks|We were missing some bugs and realized we needed to write some tests for the copy constructor. We decided to copy the test from the assignment operator since they perform a similar operations on the list and we wanted to test that the copy constructor was working in a similar manner to the assignment operator. As such, our last two tests ended up being very similar but tested different functions. The autograder flags this as code duplication despite them testing different functions. We chose to have two similar tests because we felt that having a similar test case will allow us to more clearly see the problems with the functions we were testing. Are we supposed to use different data sets even though the functions are different but the data sets and the operations we use to test our functions are the same?. .

lfu3bk2v8ud5qr|Deep copy/overloaded assignment operator|". The big three confuses me, and I'm trying to make sure I implemented the overloaded assignment operator correctly and am correctly making a deep copy of a list. Here, it says that even though the two copies' ""elements"" arrays point to the same array, their respective addresses in memory are different (0x1000 vs 0x1010). . . By this logic, I cannot check the beginning address of a list to ensure I've made a deep copy and not a shallow copy, because even a shallow copy would have two different addresses. Am I understanding this correctly? If so, is there anything else I can do to check that I've implemented the operator correctly? "|87|0|active|I can see how that image is confusing. I believe the addresses you pointed out are the addresses of the pointers themselves, and not the addresses they are pointing to. This is an image of what not to do to make a deep copy. . . If your question is about testing if the copy made is deep or shallow, I would recommend using iterators. Assign a pre-built list (list1) to another list (list2) and set iterators to the first spot in both of them. The iterator == operation can then be used to check if they are pointing to the same spot in memory.. . Hope this helps!||0

For example, you might have written in your code:. int & operator*() {.       //insert code. }. But this function should not be returning an int, but the type T (template).. So the correct formatting would be:. T & operator*() {.       //insert code. }. Hope this helps!||1

lfu0bwd4mt14k5|iterator erase function|Are we allowed to change the function signature to pass in the Iterator by reference instead of value? . . My issue is that if I have 2 iterators that point to different elements of the list, and then use erase for both iterators, both iterators should be set to nullptr (so we can invalidate the iterators and not use them anymore).. . This means that if I use the == operator with the 2 iterators, it should return true since == is comparing the Iterators' node_ptrs (which are now both nullptr). . . My test is returning false though, which I think is because the current function passes Iterators in by value. So can we change the signature?|124|0|active|You should not change the function signature, I would instead change your tests -- if the tests are invalid with the signature as-is, AG will mark them as a false positive anyway||0

lftwbld552t2l7|how do I test these two functions|how to I test these two functions?. . . List & operator= (const List &rhs){. .  T& operator*()|93|0|active|Well, the point of this operator of List = is to make it where you can set a list to equal another. Knowing this, you know that if your operator works properly that both lists should be copies of each other. This would mean they should have the same size, and elements. These observable characteristics are where you can make some tests for the operator.  . . Then for your second operator is the dereference operator. This is supposed to give you the datum of a given node. Knowing this, you could make a list with some elements and then test if you dereference a node that it gives you the proper datum. . . I hope this helps you! ||0
lftvndwsayr2ls|Assignment operator delete[]|I am confused on what we should be deleting in the assignment operator for list .... in other words, what comes after delete[] ? I was thinking maybe the first pointer because that would go through all the nodes and delete them until the original list was empty .. . Also ... should there be a conditional in the assignment operator function that separates the case where the list we are assigning to is empty? I was not sure if calling delete[] on an empty list would result in a seg fault.. . Thank you!|99|0|active|Remember that a linked list is not like a normal array in the sense that it is not sequential in memory so delete[] would not be the way to delete the list. If you just delete the first node, the remaining nodes will still be there and there will be a memory leak as you could not be able to access the rest. You should think about using a certain function to remove every item individually which you probably implemented before the assignment overloading function. Also the condition you are talking about should be handled in that one function.||0

lftuqkkaj4q5h2|Copy Constructor unidentified behaviour|I submitted my test cases to the autograder which resulted in a UB/leak when testing the copy constructor of list in a test case. What might be the problem here? I dont think i am dereferencing a nullptr or not deleting an object on the heap after going through the debugger.. |88|3|active|The copy constructor is trying to access the datum of a Node that doesn't exist or doesn't exist anymore. This is probably because the next (or prev) points to something other than a nullptr, so the Iterator continues the valid list and tries to copy from uninitialized memory. Check in the debugger for whether next points to 0x0 for the last Node in the list during the copying function. If not, there is likely a problem with any function that modifies the list e.g. push and pop. Make sure to consider cases where the affected Node is the only Node in a list, the first in a list, the last in a list, etc. It it does, I would check the condition on which the function stops copying.||1

If not, how do they work?|118|0|active|From the lecture and office hours, I have heard that you can't check for private test cases, but the best way to check leaks is to rigorously test the functions. Also, the biggest way to check leaks is to look through the profs lecture where they tell you if are running into traps when writing functions like pop back, pop front, etc. Additionally, another way to check because macOS does sometimes take care of things that other systems don't you can go and login into CAEN Linux.

Try using those properties for your asserts. You can do this for erase and other functions. ||0

For example, I want to insert this number in between the two elements. . Once you know what you want, the behavior to be, look at the functions you are using to achieve the behavior and look at the RMEs and make sure that they are supposed to behave that way. After all of this you should know how to set up the environment to test what you want. . The biggest problem with tests if that most people look at their own code and write the tests but that could lead to you catering to behavior that isn't intended for the project that you should be catching with the tests.

lfsmf19piu5ce|Error Handling for Errant Requests|I'm asking for clarification on the types of errant requests that we will need to account for.. . In the spec it mentions that all GET and DELETE requests will have a content length of 0 and no json object. However, in the file public_error01.in, we get an errant GET request because the path isn't one of the three (api, api/queue/head/, api/queue/) but also that the length is 2 and we have a blank json object to account for. . . So I have two questions:. Are there only two cases for erroneous requests? . Where the method/path are incorrect, but the content length and json align with the request type. (GET/DELETE have length 0 and no json)Where both the method/path are incorrect and the content length and json don't follow the appropriate format. (like the public_error01 file where the GET request has a length/json). If no to the question above, will there ever be an errant request where the method and path are correct, but the content length/json object aren't correct? (ex: correct request and path: GET /api/ , but the content length isn't 0).|97|2|active|||0

Here is an example of the error:. error: cannot bind non-const lvalue reference of type ‘List<int>::Iterator&’ to an rvalue of type ‘List<int>::Iterator’. . And another error I get when I make the functions return by reference:. error: binding reference of type ‘List<int>::Iterator&’ to ‘const List<int>::Iterator’ discards qualifiers. . Any help would be appreciated.|126|0|active|You are correct that the error is because you are returning by reference. Consider the logic here: if you return a value by reference from a function, then it should be a value that will continue existing after the end of the function call. `begin()` and `end()` both create and return an iterator, so if you return by reference it will return the object in that function call's stack frame instead of something that continues living after the end of the function call.. . So it would be incorrect to return by reference in `begin()` and `end()` -- you want to return by value so that you can access and use a different object in the caller function's stack frame.||0

lfrhegmv9xr1ai|questions about iterator|I have been waiting on the oh queue for 3 hours but it said something like you were kicked out of the server, it crashed. . . We have a few questions. One of our pressing issues was the comparison operator in iterator class. This is the function:. . bool operator==(Iterator rhs) const {.           // 1.  return node_ptr == rhs.node_ptr;.           // 2.  return node_ptr->datum == rhs.node_ptr->datum;. }. . We are unsure whether we are comparing pointers (1) or comparing the datum at those pointers (2). When we tried the 1st one, our code always fails and the assert statements don't work. However, when are comparing the datum, it works. Right now, it only works because there is no duplicate datum in an of our lists. However, if first had 2 and last had 2, our code would work since they have the same datum but we know that the iterators are pointing to two different places. so we are really confused. . . . We were also very confused about the erase() function iterator. This is our implementation: . . void erase(Iterator i) {.         for(Node *np = first; np; np = np->next) {.             if(np->datum == i.node_ptr->datum) {.                 delete np;.                 return;.             }.         }.         return;.    }. .

Use helper functions: If you have a common pattern of code that you use in multiple places, consider creating a helper function that encapsulates that pattern.

lflvpql4viz7ga|Iterator Erase|After we erase a node, what happens to the iterator. Does it get deleted too?Thanks.|239|0|active|In general, when you erase a node from a linked list, any iterators that point to that node become invalid. This means that you should not attempt to dereference or use an iterator that points to an erased node.. . However, erasing a node does not delete the iterator itself. The iterator remains valid, but it points to an undefined location in memory. If you attempt to dereference an invalid iterator, your program may crash or exhibit undefined behavior.. . To avoid using invalid iterators after erasing a node, you should reset the iterator by setting it to .end() or .begin().||1

In my code if we call L1.insert(i2,3); and then L1.insert(i1,4); the first element in the list will be 3 and the 2nd element will be 4 because my insert works by first comparing the pointer in the iterator to ""first"", which in this case is nullptr. So, 3 will be added as the 1st and only element. Then, as the pointer in i1 is nullptr and the first pointer already changed (because now 3 is in the list), i1 will now be treated as ""past the end"" pointer, not first pointer even though I declare it with begin();. Is this an issue that needs to be solved because if this list is not empty, calling (L1.insert(i2,3); and then L1.insert(i1,4);) will add 3 as the last element and 4 as the 1st element."|215|0|active|You're correct that both `i1` and `i2` will point to `nullptr` when the list is empty.. . This is not an issue you need to solve, and is as intended.

Users of your `List` class should re-define their iterators after modifying the list to make them valid again.||0

This helps us find you on the autograder to take a look at your code if we need it to help answer your question!. . From what I'm seeing in the error and looking online, it looks like you need to overload the operator== for your Student class that and have it take in a const Student. Some of the stl functions, including remove, require a const reference as a value to compare against. . . These posts provide some more detail and should be helpful:. Removing element from vector: Invalid operands to binary expression (stack overflow).

lfiwupaolsr9t|Indexing into a List|Is there a way to index into a standard list? I was reading through the details on cplusplus.com and I didn't find a way to index into the list or an overload of the [] operator or anything like that. I'm not sure if I just skipped over it or if we're supposed to do it some other way like using the iterator or something?|154|0|active|Indexing requires the elements to be contiguous in memory, so that once you know where the head is and the index, you can directly look for the element at the destination address.. Since list nodes are not contiguous in memory, even though we know head and index, we cannot directly compute the destination address and look for it. We have to access each node to get the address of the next node until we reach the destination (e.g. having done this index times).||1
lfive1bgyp848e|Popping the front of JSON array?|Since we're using a JSON array to keep track of students in queue in order to display the queue when GET /api/queue/ is requested, how would we go about popping the JSON at the front of the array once DELETE is requested without leaving an extra JSON in the back of the array? For example, If I were to use a for loop to assign the first element to the next and so on, I would still be left with an extra copy of the last JSON in the back of the JSON array as it is fixed in size.|253|0|active|I'm not exactly sure I've understood your question completely, but if you are storing students in an array, then that might not be the best strategy.. You are correct that arrays have the problem of being fixed in size, and that's why we don't want to use arrays when we need to insert and remove elements frequently.. In this project, we've specifically asked you to store students in a list, which is dynamic in size. If you are storing students both in a list and an array, then think about if it is necessary..

lfiku397sqr4mj|api.cpp json cin clarification|When reading in a request using JSON, which items should be made JSON objects? Are we reading in strings for each of the headers, then one JSON object for the body? Or are we creating one large JSON object, where each of the headers have their own key-value pairs and the body is one key value pair? Or does every item, (body included) get its own individual key-value pair?. . Additionally, if we're reading everything to JSON then is there only one argv argument (./api.exe)?|193|0|active|"Since everything is read through ""cin,"" you are correct in that the only element in argv will be ""./api.exe"" (or something similar).When reading in a request, the JSON library will only accept input that is formatted as JSON. In other words, you *have* to read the headers in as strings (two of which you will save, the rest can be ignored/discarded). Once the headers have been read in, you can simply call ""cin >> body"" (where ""body"" is of type ""json"") to read in the JSON body of the request into the ""body"" variable. These steps can then be repeated in some form of loop in order to read in all of the requests."||1
lfijvsp7wij3jr|erase and insert clarification|Hello, so I'm currently trying to implement my erase and insert functions, and I was just wondering how they're intended to work. From what I understand, erase is supposed to delete the element our iterator is pointing to, therefore causing the iterator to point to null. Insert is supposed to insert an element before the element our iterator is pointing to, would this replace the previous node, or is it supposed to make space and then insert the element? I'm a bit confused here so if anyone could give me a general rundown, I'd really appreciate it.|258|0|active|Insert is supposed to make space and then insert the element before the Iterator. To get started, there are three cases I would check (iterator is pointing to the first in the list, the last in the list, or otherwise in between). You can make use of the push and pop functions you implemented in List in some of these cases.||1
lfihsizfx2u5tp|Big 3 Confusion|Quick quesiton:. Why is copy_all private? Should we make the other big 3 items (constructor, destructor, assignment) private as well?|285|0|active|copy\_all is private because it is a helper function for the list implementation. (ie. you can use it in your implementation of the big three, if you decide the big three is needed). We do not want copy\_all to be public because it copies all nodes in the list, which breaks the interface of list.h. Remember, we don't want the individual nodes of the list to be _directly_ modified/accessed by any random user of the list.. . If you write the big three for this project, it should be public. This is because the big three provides the tools needed to use the list properly for any person using the class. Otherwise, any person trying to use our list would run into errors where they would not be able to assign/copy variables, or properly destroy variables when they exit scope. This would defeat the purpose of having a publicly accessible list!. . Hope this helps!||1

lfg71n83tanwf|after erase(it1), does the it1 disappear?|From the example in std::list, it1 move to point next node after erase(t1). But if we cannot change the interface and add & , that is, cannot change `void erase(Iterator i)` to `void erase(Iterator &i)`. Does that mean we will not able to reuse it1 in test?|217|0|active|it1 is an iterator pointing to a node. After you erase the node it1 points to(you are not erasing it1 itself), you can no longer access the node, but you can freely change the node it1 points to.. It is the same for pointers: say ptr is a pointer that points to a dynamically allocated object. When we delete ptr;, we are not deleting ptr itself but the object ptr points to. Then that object is no longer accessible, but you can freely let ptr point to other objects.||0

For first node: ""next"" points to second node, and ""prev"" points to the ""first"" pointer's address. . For last node: ""next"" points to nullptr and ""prev"" points to penultimate node. . . Please let me know if these are correct assumptions."|121|0|active|For nodes in the middle (that is, not first or last node), the prev and next stores the address of the previous node and the node after it. . . For the first node, you should use a sentinel value for the prev pointer like a nullptr to let yourself know that this is the first node. Likewise, the next value of the last node should be nullptr (it could be something else if you really want to do it that way).

How would the computer know what request to do?|309|0|active|Yes, the part before the json ({}) does get read, but only the first two items (which make up the request) actually matter. The rest can be read with cin and remain unused. The last slide of the p4 intro slides in the faq may help with this.||0
lf5kzm1l71p3yv|Exit Status 2 for the tests|I wrote some test cases for List.h and they all run and pass when I use my terminal. However, when I submitted my tests to autograder, it said the exit status was 2 and no test cases were submitted. I included everything exactly as in public test, so I wonder what might have caused this problem.|238|0|active|"""List_tests.cpp:87:25: error: variable ‘iterator2’ set but not used"". You have an used variable in your test case file, hence the compiler is giving an error."||0
lf4qr59f3ybai|[Important] P4 FAQ|"This is the thread for P4 FAQ's.  Reminder P4 is due on Wednesday, March 29th at 8pm! This really saves us so much time when helping you whether it be looking up your code on the AG or doing anything exam related.. The p4 intro session to be determined.. . Q: What is a linked list/iterator?. A: A linked list is another kind of container and an iterator is an object used to traverse and access elements in a container. You can refer to the lecture slides or the class notes (https://eecs280staff.github.io/notes/) if you have any questions..  . Q: Why am I getting an error related to accessing a private member of Iterator in a List function?. A: By default private members of the nested Iterator class are not accessible to the List class. The solution is friendship! We'll be covering friend declarations in the Iterator lecture. .  . Q: Should I test the destructor/How do I test the destructor?. A: You should write tests for every function that you can. You're not responsible for testing the destructor in your test cases, but you should use a tool like valgrind to ensure that your code isn't leaking memory. You shouldn't call the destructor explicitly! The compiler does so automatically when the object dies..  . Q: Why am I getting a segfault/undefined behavior?. A: Address Sanitizers are a great way to see where memory leaks and undefined behavior are in your program, which is very common in this project!! Segfaults and undefined behavior are typically the result of not initializing your variables or having pointers that point to bad memory (example being data that has been deleted). If you see these errors, try using the Address Sanitizers (found at this tutorial) to help debug your program..  . Q: Why does my test case compile on CAEN, but not on the Autograder?. A: Double check that you haven't added any public functions or made one that was originally declared private, public. Also, double check that you've not put using namespace std in a header file. Also, you can't compare an Iterator with a pointer.. . Q: How do I start api.cpp? What should the program look like?. A: Be sure to check out the project intro slides here.  They include information that you may find useful when implementing api.cpp.  Think about where you need to take input from, and what different things your program needs to be able to do with it. Then, break your code up into different functions or a class or whatever structure you'd like - just try and keep things organized, and don't just use one giant function.. . Q: On the style check I'm getting a ""memory is allocated but not initialized"" error whenever I create a Node.  But I'm initializing my Node data member variables in the lines directly following.  How do I fix this?. A:  This occurs because the style checker sees that you create your Node on one line, but is not smart enough to check the following lines to see that you initialize the members of the newly created Node. This can be solved in a few different ways.. . Default constructing your members then initializing them.. . Node* n = new Node{};. n->datum = datum;. .... . Using brace intialization to create the new node.. . Node* n = new Node{next_in, prev_in, datum};. . Creating a default constructor for Node.. . We recommend options 1 or 2, since they are easiest to implement and integrate into your existing code. Option 3 is a little more complex, but good practice.. . Happy coding!. pinkedlists.

lf3dyoe4t6jgq|List_compile_check.cpp|Hello,. . Given the file List_compile_check.cpp, it seems that there are mistakes with the operands. I'm assuming we either implement the operands in the file or I had a mistake in the file, but when I opened the File I had 9 mistakes due to the operands. are we supposed to implement the undefined operands?. . Thank you.|8|0|private|Yep, you have to implement operands such as ++ and * for Iterator||0

If you're really curious, you're welcome to take a look at past semesters' P4 spec, but keep in mind changes may be made until it's officially released. Unlike the past few semesters, we're also planning on having students complete the full P4 this time, instead of just the linked list implementation.||0
