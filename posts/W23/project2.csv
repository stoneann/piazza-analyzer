ld3kepqars3bm|Project 2 FAQ|"Refer to this post for Frequently Asked Questions regarding Project 2. Project 2 is due Friday, February 3 at 8pm.  Please keep the followups related to questions in this post only.. Spec is here. .  . Resize GUI repository (you can use this to easily try your resize code on other images!): https://github.com/oalejel/resize-GUI.  . Write clear code! This is especially important for this project, remember:. Matrix width = # of columns. Matrix height = # of rows. Instead of using variables like ""i"" and ""j"" in your for-loops, consider using ""row"" and ""col"" so you don't get confused!. . Main Project Files Questions (Matrix.h, Image.h, processing.cpp, resize.cpp). . Q: When should I use the -> operator? . A: For Matrix, use the -> operator when you are implementing functions only in the Matrix.h file. Good coding style keeps the direct access to matrix objects using the -> operator to a specific set of functions. We actually consider this incorrect behavior, even if you get the right results, so please make sure you use the right function. The same goes for Image and Pixel. . . Q: Why do I have to write functions like Matrix_width? Couldn't I just use matrix->width directly?. A: As explained in the previous question, you should only use the -> operator to directly access a type of struct in a specific set of functions. In Image.h functions and resize.cpp, if you want to access the width of a matrix, you can’t use the -> operator, so we need a function.. . Q: Am I required to use traversal by pointer?. A: No. You are allowed to, but not required to use traversal by pointer in this project. You should choose to traverse by index/pointer based on what makes sense to you logically..  . Q: My program takes a couple minutes or more to run. Is this expected?. A: Yes, but not too long - your program should run in under 30 seconds. Double check that you're not looping unnecessarily or calling an inefficient function within a loop. Perf is also a helpful tool for improving efficiency! https://eecs280staff.github.io/p2-cv/#appendix-b-perf-tutorial.  . Q: Rotate left is failing, even though it was provided. Is there an error in the provided function?. A: Rotate left calls several student implemented image functions, which can cause errors in rotate left.. . Q: Why do we need to create a copy of the image in remove_vertical_seam? How can we do it?. A: When removing a vertical seam, the image has to be smaller. Images are array’s, which have a fixed size, so we have to create a new image that is smaller. We can then copy the pixels over one by one, removing the desired pixels as you go. Since we are passing in an Image pointer, we are passing an address to an Image object. We can then change the pointer to point to the new image object created. Write out a memory diagram to help visualize how this works!.  . Testing Questions. . Q: How can I test Matrix_at without breaking the interface?. A: When thinking of unit testing, you should think in units as behavior instead of units as functions, because it is common to have functions like Matrix_at that solely rely on the underlying implementation. When testing Matrix_at, we really want to test the behavior of setting and retrieving independent values reliably from our matrix. For example, you could test that setting a value at (0,1) doesn't modify the value at (1,0) or other similar variations of this.. . Q: Why am I failing crabster but passing dog and horses?. A: Crabster tends to catch more edge cases. Be sure that in all cases you're checking the correct columns when you compute the energy, cost, and seam.. . Q: One of my processing test is failing, but when I print out the output it matches the correct file.. A: Double check your image init. If you read in the correct image incorrectly, then Image_equal will fail even if you've processed the image correctly.. . Q: I am missing some test cases. What other tests should I write to catch the test cases?. A: Sorry! We don't share what test cases the AG is looking for. The best advice we can give it to brainstorm more edge cases. . . Q: When will project grades be released?. A: You will be able to see your score including the private tests on the autograder approximately a week after the project deadline.. . Setup Questions. . Q: I'm trying to run processing_public_test.cpp/resize.cpp on XCode, and Xcode is saying that it's unable to open dog.ppm/crabster.ppm/horses.ppm.. A: You need to update XCode's custom working directory: https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_xcode.html#run.  . Happy coding!"|1116|1|active|||0

Whenever something works locally but not on the autograder check for undefined behavior.. . I did look at your code and saw what might be causing the issue. Remember that the Matrix_min_value_in_row ending bound is exclusive! That means it won't analyze the column_end index given. For example if you wanted to search the first two columns in a row (aka columns 0 and 1). You would have to pass in column_start = 0 and column_end = 2.

ldo2eiyx9tj2vt|TEST(test_print_basic) Out of bounds error with matrix_at()|I am currently debugging my void Image_print(const Image* img, std::ostream& os) and running the test case given already. It runs into an error at Image_set_pixel(img, 1, 0, blue); . I tried debugging by stepping into the function and I found that it's an error at my. . int* Matrix_at(Matrix* mat, int row, int column). It's been working perfectly ok for all of my Matrix tests. However, by passing through a width of 1 and any column size less than 2 (the width of the matrix) it gives me an error. The error says I'm indexing out of bounds, but I don't understand how I am because I manually calculated what index I am at according to the function I wrote and it's inside the arr size. I am not quite too sure if I wrote my function wrong if this is the only case that the matrix_at doesn't work.. EDIT: I did a bit more debugging and found that it doesn't grasp the width of the mat. If I have an int = width of mat, in the next line of code (the return statement), it resets it back to a random integer which causes it to index out of bounds. I have no clue why it's doing this.

Here, `MATRIX_HEIGHT` is a runtime constant---it might be different when you run it on different images, but every time the function runs, it can't be changed once the image-dependent number is set. What the language really requires here is a compile-time constant, or a ""constant expression"", a number that the compiler knows for sure and is used by the compiled program for all possible images. Therefore, we need a number that accommodates all the images we promise to accommodate. What's the maximum height of an Image? (Hint: what's the maximum height of a Matrix? How much space do we set aside for each Matrix?) To potentially accommodate input images that have that precise height, **we should set this to the maximum possible height of an Image**.

Here's what you (and others encountering problems that look similar) can do:. . - Familiarize yourself with conditional breakpoints [here](https://eecs280staff.github.io/tutorials/debugging_guide.html#conditional-breakpoints).. - Find the first number in your program's output that does not match the corresponding number in the correct output.. - Set up a conditional breakpoint where the condition is ""we found that first incorrect number"", like `cost == 10839`.. - Debug the program. It should stop at the conditional breakpoint where your first incorrect number was determined. Figure out how the incorrect number came to be by inspecting the variables and thinking through your logic. If you're in VSCode, you can add expressions to the ""watch"" pane between ""call stack"" and ""variables"" to evaluate them. For example, you can add the expression `*Matrix_at(cost, r-1, c-1)` to the Watch section and see what it evaluates to.. . In the author's specific case, there was a suspicious constant in `Matrix_min_value_in_row`. All the costs were greater than 10000. What would happen in this case?"||0

Would we have to code to protect against this possible private case where the final size of the image has at least one dimension of 1? I can provide additional clarifying information if necessary.|146|2|active|This is a good question. Your program should still work if either or both dimensions for the image is 1. . . . then it would break the functions because the bounds of some of our nested loops are set to width/height - 1. . If your for loop starts at 0 (or 1), since it should end at width - 1 = 0 in this case, it will immediately terminate the for loop. If this is not what is happening, I suggest carefully looking at your code and see how you can change your for loops (as an example, there might be more things to look at). I can tell you that you won't need to consider this as a standalone edge case if your functions' implementation closely follows the spec.||1

Then another for loop to set the pixels on temp on the right side of the seam to pixels on img + 1. Then I set img equal to temp. . . However, I've been getting some really weird behavior out of my function. For starters running that code for dog outputs this strange image:. . . .

In the rotate_right function we are provided with, can we also say img = aux (without the * for both) to let the the img pointer point to the address where the aux pointer points to, which is the aux matrix? Also, when we delete aux, are we only deleting the pointer, or are we also deleting the data in the aux matrix?. . |4|0|private|Note that img is being passed by value, not by reference. So setting the pointer to be another pointer in this context is somewhat meaningless. Deferencing img and setting it to be equal to the data of aux is acceptable. When you do delete aux, that deletes the underlying data aux is associated with on the heap.||1

ldhz2qd4hzp676|pointer to new Matrix|Hi, I'm running into a problem where I used the given test_fill_basic test module and initialized a 2x3 matrix with all values of 43. After deleting mat at the end of that test module, I made a test module for a more complicated Matrix_print test. When i initialized my new matrix, this time a 3x3 one, assigning row 0, column 1 to the value of 42, it looks like my mat pointer returned to the original matrix initialized in the test_fill_basic module, printing the 43s with my reassigned 42 value. Should this be expected?|159|0|active|"It sounds like the memory used for your first matrix was reused for the second one, hence the ""43"" values left over. Your operating system may reuse a pool of memory without first ""clearing"" its values for the sake of performance. However, this behavior isn't guaranteed to happen on all platforms (or even with consecutive runs of the test on your computer). Thus, you want to make sure your tests initialize all values in a Matrix before checking all values (which is what Matrix_print() technically does) to avoid non-determinism.

Is it an array of pointers?  And how does it relate to img?|243|1|active|We're dealing with the cost matrix, which is essentially a matrix that you already made which copies the dimensions of the image and has the cost of each pixel from your energy matrix.In find minimal_vertical_seam, we are just working with the cost matrix in order to find the lowest cost path from the bottom of the matrix to the top and storing that path into the seam array.So, seam is just an array of integers, specifically column numbers for the lowest cost pixel in each row. So seam[0] = lowest cost pixel in the 0th row, and so on. This is why the specs recommend Matrix_column_of_min_value_in_row for filling the seam array. Make sure you start from the bottom row as specified in the specs tho, since the first row all have the same cost. I would recommend looking at the images in the specs again if any of this is confusing!So no, you don't really work with the image until the remove vertical seam function, so u don't need to call any img functions or pixel stuff since you're just working with a matrix.||0

The reason you are getting an error there is mat->data is defined to be a matrix of max size * max size length. The array you are setting it to is not of that type since it is of a different size. Another note for using matrix_at is that you want to respect the interfaces we’ve provided for you. You could make a helper function in your test file that takes in a array of values and a mat pointer. In a for loop, this function could then assign values using matrix_at. This would avoid needing to rewrite code for this test case set up. ||0

Has anyone experienced something similar?|170|0|active|I recommend you run these problematic tests under your debugger, so you can see exactly which line the segmentation fault is occurring on. It's possible your index calculation in Matrix_at() is incorrect, and thus you're returning a pointer to invalid memory. It's also possible your index calculation is correct, but you are returning a pointer to an object that no longer exists after Matrix_at() returns (such as a local variable), rather than a pointer to an integer in the Matrix's data array.

ldepzqphtez51y|Second image_init RGB values|I'm confused on what the second Image_Init function (the one with istream is as a parameter) needs to do with the pixels. If it's supposed to set the individual pixels based on the information from the istream, how does that differ from set_Pixel?. . So far I've initialized the Matrix structs for each color channel (red, green, and blue). I then have a nested loop that  reads in the pixel values for each color channel by iterating through the rows and columns of the image, and I'm guessing I have to use matrix_at or matrix_fill somehow, but I'm confused on what I'm supposed to do with them and what to do inside this loop generally.. . Also, am I supposed to read in three values at a time? |296|1|active|This image init function is to read in ppm images. Look at dog.ppm in your starter files for an example of what it should be. It differs from set pixel in that the init function reads everything that is given and the set pixel function only changes the value of one pixel in the whole image. . . In your loops, you basically need to change the rgb matrices to match the values that are given. Note that this is an init function, and you would probably need to set width and height of the image and use Matrix init for the rgb matrices.. . And lastly, yes. Apart from the header which has P3, width, height, and max intensity, everything is 3 values at a time. Note that you don’t need to care about P3 and max intensity since I believe the spec says you’re basically guaranteed these will be the same values.||0

This just means the `Matrix`-pointer has been allocated using `new` and then initialized using the `Matrix_init()` function and thus has valid height/width properties.. . ```cpp. Matrix *mat = new Matrix;. Matrix_init(mat);. // mat now points to a valid Matrix!. ```. . > `ptr` points to an element in the `Matrix`. >. > Does this mean the address this pointer points to needs to be within the address range of the `Matrix->data` array?. >. Yes."||2

lddkysewg2y1ft|Image_init (istream) Unsure how to finish the function|. I'm trying to write the image init function and I'm pretty confused how to use is<<. I've tried reading other piazza questions and the project spec but I'm still confused. How should I get rid of the P3 term? And is using a while loop the right way to get the pixel colors? I just don't know how to use istream to store the colors. |7|0|private|Using a `while` loop here is a good idea. And, yes, you can read `P3` into a random variable as you won't be needing it later. Regarding reading pixels into your image, are there any functions that you've written in `image.cpp` that would allow you to store the pixels into an image?||0

If you mean that the pixel values are not displayed in a 5x5, whitespaces/new lines in the input file do not matter. For example, you could have all the pixel values on one line. If you're reading in the pixel values correctly using cin, you shouldn't have to worry about doing anything extra for whitespace. "||0

ldda1ahegsf1ib|remove_vertical_seam function - copying over edited image to original|I'm a little confused on how to copy over the auxiliary image to the original image -- I understand the concept of updating the img pointer to point to a new value but I'm not sure how to go about doing it. My original thought was to create a pointer to each element in my image copy and set the pointer to the corresponding row and column in the original image equal to that. However, there isn't an image analog for Matrix_at so I wasn't sure what to use|154|0|active|Try not to overthink it. Let `aux` be a pointer to the newly created image, and suppose `img` is a pointer to the old image. Then you can access the actual image objects for each by dereferencing each. Then it's just a matter of setting the dereferenced old image to the dereferenced new image.||1

If so, wouldn't that just give zero, since we initialized the energy matrix to be filled with zeros?"|188|0|active|I'd say your first thought sounds reasonable. Try to go through the graph in the specification of this project again, and you should think of no matter where is the pixel (except at the border), there is a universal way to express the location of its neighbors (has something to do with row and column number associated with the location of X - which is the central pixel). .

Your program should be able to open files, give any necessary error outputs, and output files, all from the command line inputs.. . Yes you should open an ifstream, and no it won’t give you an image pointer. It gives you a ifstream in the form of ppm format file, so you should be using one of the functions you previously wrote (i’m assuming you did matrix, image and processing) to read in this ppm file.

It can just be assumed that the parameters are valid in p2.. . The longer answer is that `sizeof` will return the size of a type or variable in *bytes*. So if we know the size of the array and the size of an integer, we can divide them to get the number of integers in an array.. . ```. int length = sizeof(seam) / sizeof(int);  . ```. **EDIT:** Since the seam is passed into `find_minimal_vertical_seam`, it does not encode its total size---it is just a pointer, or a memory address.

So, while they do point to the same location, they don't reference the same things, and will give different values when dereferenced.. .

Another (cleaner) way to do this in one step is to use the arrow operator (`->`) which will dereference mat and use the dot operator. . .

However, you still need to initialize these with a call to Matrix_init to ensure they are the right size!"" (copied from the website).. .

ld580u0usgs3po|Git|Hey, I am not sure If this was clear or not, but what is the point of using git/github when it comes to project 2 or in general? I am new to it, so just wanted some clarification.|224|1|active|"Again, excellent question.. . Source (or Version) Control is just a term for any system to keep track of source code (C++ code) over time. . An example of source control might be to make a copy of your original file, edit the code, and then save it as a new name. That way every day you've worked on your project, you can track how much you've done.. Another example of source control might be emailing yourself files after each work session.. These are both source control techniques that I used when I was a freelance graphic designer. By keeping track of different versions of my graphics, I could be more flexible. Say an astroturf company wanted the buttons on their website to all be blue. So you make 'em blue. Now say they want to change them to pink. Alright, easy. Now say they want to change it back to blue. You might go through the easy but tedious process of changing all the buttons to blue, but that costs you time, and thus your client money. With source control, I could just revert my design to when the buttons were blue in a couple of clicks.. . GitHub is just one of the tools that builds in a bunch of great features that emails do not replicate so well. But there's plenty more out there: GitLab, SVN, Perforce, and more.. We chose GitHub for this course because it's the one most frequently used in industry. From personal experience, I know Tesla uses it, but Ubisoft uses Perforce, and another university I went to used SVN. Luckily, learning one makes learning the others really easy.. . Reason 1:. It's 11pm on March 8th, 2022, you've been coding for the past three hours and while you were close to finishing the project, you submit to the autograder and find that your score has gone down. Why the heck would that happen?. . . . With source control, I can see what changes I made on March 8th. . . . It looks like somewhere in this code, I must have broken something. Not only does that means I now know where to look for my bug, it also means that if ALL else fails, I can just git rid of those specific changes and go back to the version of my code that worked correctly.. . Reason 2:. Say you want to give your client proof of the work you've put in. You can show them a history of the changes you've made over time. For example, on Google Slides, I used version control to find out that I added this great slide at 12:03PM. . . Reason 3: Your laptop dies. Technology is fickle and painful. It will die on you when you least expect it. If you've ever made a backup of your computer, that's a kind of version control too. When I started programming, I broke my laptop, and then accidentally flung my backup drive against a wall. I lost all of my data.. With source control, you know that your code will be stored remotely, so if you need to download it on any other computer anywhere else in the world, you can do so very easily.. . Reason 4: Collaboration. This is the meat and potatoes of version control. Emailing files might work okay when you're working alone. But what if you've got a partner, or two, or three, or four hundred? You send an email to everyone with your code changes for the day, and they do the same. Then, it turns out that you've both changed the same file. Which version do you use? How do you get both people's code in. Now before you submit, you need to make sure you've properly weaved both peoples' codes into one file and test to make sure nothing was missed. This takes a LONG time. Not to mention, you might accidentally overwrite one-another's code.. . GitHub automates the process. With GitHub, when you make a change, you can ""push"" that change to a remote server somewhere across the world whose whole business is funded on the guarantee that your data never gets lost. Then, your partner can ""pull"" those changes from the server, and the server will automatically merge their version with your new changes. They can go on about their business, and when they're done, ""push"" their code. You can now ""pull"" and get those changes as well. This makes working together much faster.. . Reason 5: Branching. Say I'm making a game prototype, and I'm not sure if the tennis balls should be round, oval, or cubes. I want to make all three versions and send them to my partners to, who are responsible for whether the ball is green, blue, or red. By email, this would involve an ever increasing number of files being passed around, until suddenly you're downloading tennis_match1.cpp, tennis_match2.cpp, etc.... . In GitHub, you can have multiple ""branches."" Say one branch for oval balls, one for cube balls, and one for round balls. This means that when you want to switch to the ""branch"" of code with the cube balls, you can decide to pull JUST that branch, and your IDE will switch all your files to that parallel universe. It's really great.. . . Hopefully that was all convincing enough, but I'm happy to expand if you'd like. Another really cool use of version control-esque behavior is the Wayback Machine, which lets you scour the web to see what Facebook looked like in 2008, or what your mother's website looked like before it was attacker by ransomware.. . .

ld55mpmdelv217|Matrix_init function - initializing the data array|I know that when you initialize a new Matrix, you need to make a 1D int array of a certain size.

It has three member variables: `width`, `height`, and `data`. The last of which is a 1D `int` array representation of the matrix.

It is implemented using a 1d array, but from the user's perspective, they can ""imagine"" it as a 2d array.. . This is an example of an abstraction.. We provide a ""2d"" interface to the user, but under the hood, we implement it using a 1d array.. . Assuming that Matrix is implemented correctly, we can access its elements by using the Matrix_at function.. The interface for Matrix_at is specified in Matrix.h.. . ---------------------------------------------------------. . Below is a small example:. Imagine we have a Matrix of width: 3, height: 2. Let's fill it with some random numbers.. We can visualize this matrix as:. 183 280 281. 203 370 376. . But under the hood, the data looks like: [183, 280, 281, 203, 370, 376].

Matrix_at(mat, 0, 1);. . ---------------------------------------------------------. . Just want to stress again the role of abstraction here.. From the user's perspective, a Matrix is a 2d array that can be accessed using row and column.. From the developer's perspective, a Matrix is a 1d array - we have to write some code to provide the illusion that this is a 2d array to the user.. . Hope this helps!"||0

I would recommend starting with Matrix_init, Matrix_width, and Matrix_height. These functions are the shortest for matrix.cpp and will help you quickly knock some functions out of the way.. . Next, I would work on Matrix_row and Matrix_column while paying attention to this portion of the spec that talks about the underlying 1-D array that we use to represent a 2-D matrix. After completing those two, I'd work on the two versions of Matrix_at which should feel more familiar after completing Matrix_row and Matrix_column.. . Next, Matrix_print, Matrix_fill, Matrix_fill_border, and Matrix_max are a good group of functions to think about and work on together. Last up would be Matrix_column_of_min_value_in_row and Matrix_min_value_in_row.. . . As you're going through all of these functions, it can be really helpful to draw out small matrices and get to the goal of the function by hand (i.e. map out how you would find the row, column, max, min val, etc.). Next, think about how this scales to matrices of any size.. . Another good thing to keep in mind is how your function works as your input varies.

The course uses main, but master will suffice as well."||0

lcni6663uth2j6|Regarding Project 2 Starter Files|I want to get a head start in project 2. On EECS280.org, it says it's still the fall 2022 release. Are the starter files/specs gonna be the same for this semester?|218|0|active|Project 2 will be released soon after Project 1 is due, so the link that you found is subject to significant change until that date.. . Congrats on finishing project 1 early! I would recommend spending the time now to review lecture materials (or get some rest) until project 2.. . Edit: I made a mistake with the Project 2 release date, apologies for the confusion||2
