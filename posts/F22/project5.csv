laicotkhen03w7|P5 FAQ|"Refer to this post for Frequently Asked Questions regarding Project 5. Please keep the followups related to questions in this post only. The FAQ will be updated as the project progresses, so please check back here before posting a new question!. . Q: I've never worked with maps before.  Where can I get a crash course about map functionality?. A: Staff last semester made a p5 walkthrough video! Check it out here!  In addition, another staff member made this video a few years ago detailing a general overview of what they are and how you can use them.  In addition here is a playlist for additional help related to p5..  . Q: Should I use my Map.h implementation in the driver?. A: DO NOT DO THIS. Your implementation of Map is inefficient, and will cause problems down the road. Use the standard library implementation of map instead. (#include <map>) Great documentation can be found at http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/map/. . Q: I want to test if an Iterator points to a nullptr, how can I do this?. A: You're probably trying to compare the iterator to nullptr like this: ASSERT_EQUAL(iter, nullptr);. Because these two aren't of the same type, the unit testing framework will probably complain. Instead see if you can compare two objects of the same type - Iterator - which have the same value..  . Q: What is less? What is std::less<T>? How do I use less? . A: less is a private member variable of BST.. . It is an instance of a comparator class whose type is Compare. Compare is a template type. std::less<T> is a functor class in the stl that compares two elements of type T using the < operator. By default, Compare will be std::less<T>.. . In the BinarySearch_compile_check.cpp, there is an example of a BST with the default Compare and a BST with a custom comparator. . . . In the first case, the template will be instantiated like . Node *root;. std::less<int> less;. In the second case, the template will be instantiated like . Node *root;. DuckWealthLess less; .  . Q: What could be a cause of incorrect accuracy? . A: Make sure you're properly handling duplicate words. Make sure ties are properly handled. Make sure log-probabilities are not being rounded due to being stored in an incorrect type..  . Q: How do I record ""For each label L and word w, the number of posts with label L that contain w""? . A: You'll need a more complex data structure, since you'll need to store three pieces of information - the label, the word, and the count. There are at least two different ways to do this. Hint: The key type and/or value type of a map can be a class..  . Q: Why do my test cases compile on Caen but not the autograder?. A: Double check that you haven't broken the public interface and added a public function. Also, do not put using namespace std in a header file..  . Q: What's a csvstream and how do I use it? . A: There are three really helpful examples at https://github.com/awdeorio/csvstream..  . Q: Do we need to check for duplicates in our check_sorting_invariants_impl?. A: Your check_sorting_invariants_impl checks for a valid BST. A tree with duplicates is not a valid binary search tree. The most definitive and unambiguous description of the invariant you need to check for is described in the sorting invariants section of the spec. To be extra clear, if you were to call check_sorting_invariants on a tree that has duplicates in the right subtree, it should return false..  . Q: VSCode syntax highlighting is breaking on BinarySearchTree.h and Map.h!. A: This appears to be a bug in VSCode 1.33 regarding default template parameters. We've found a few workarounds, probably the simplest of which is to add a comment to the template declaration:. .  . Q: How fast does my code need to run?. A: You should aim for the large test case to run within a minute or so. For reference, the instructor solution takes about 5 seconds on this test case..  . Q: My code is too slow. What might be the reason?. A: Common sources of slowness include:. . Processing a post more than once (including reading it more than once or saving all the data in a vector).. . Iterating over a map to find something rather than using [] or find().. . Passing strings or containers by value.. . Iterating by value in a range-based for loop.. . pingreaterthan"|831|0|active|||0

lbjyee5ekkb65g|Autograder False Positive BST Test Case|"Reposting this because the last time it was private post to instructors and I never got a response:. . In writing test cases for BST, I wanted to check the implementation of ""less"" in the buggy code. To do this I wrote the following test case:. . . TEST(greater_int). {.   BinarySearchTree<int,greater<int> > tree;.   tree.insert(5);.   tree.insert(6);.   tree.insert(3);.   tree.insert(2);.   tree.insert(4);.   tree.insert(7);.   tree.insert(8);.   ASSERT_TRUE(*tree.min_element() == 8);.   ASSERT_TRUE(*tree.max_element() == 2);.   ASSERT_TRUE(*tree.begin() == 5);.   int i = 8;.   for(BinarySearchTree<int,greater<int> >::Iterator.   it = tree.min_element();.   it != tree.max_element(); ++it).   {.     ASSERT_TRUE(*tree.min_greater_than(i) == --i);.   }.   ASSERT_TRUE(tree.check_sorting_invariant());.   ostringstream comp;.   tree.traverse_inorder(comp);.   ASSERT_TRUE(comp.str() == ""8 7 6 5 4 3 2 "");.   ostringstream precomp;.   tree.traverse_preorder(precomp);.   ASSERT_TRUE(precomp.str() == ""5 6 7 8 3 4 2 "");. }. . What I did was pass through the greater comparison to a bst to override the less comparison, so the ordering of numbers would be reversed than what is expected. On the binary search tree header I wrote, it works correctly. This test case should pass, but autograder flagged it as a false positive. What is the issue here?"|30|0|private|||0
lbjw76megec4nt|log-likelihood if condition|Hi, I want to ask how I can determine if w was never seen in a post with label C in the training data. I try to use the contain function, but there's an error. . . . . |55|0|active|You can compare word_count[word] with word_count.end().

lbirj2fnq6g5z8|range-based loop|Hi, I want to ask whether the range-based loop always set it to an iterator, or it could be any type? For instance, for(auto it : map), what is the type of it? Is it an iterator or a pair? Also, is there any difference between. . for(std::map<Key,Val>::iterator it = myMap.begin(); it != myMap.end(); ++it). and for(auto it : myMap)?. Or they're exactly the same expression? Thank you!|49|0|active|"It depends on how you are using it (haha get it?). . Here, you are using ""it"" as an iterator, which initially points to the start of the map. std::map<Key,Val>::iterator it = myMap.begin(); it != myMap.end(); ++it. . But here, it just holds a copy of the current item. for(auto it : myMap). . In the above, auto is the type of object in your map (could be a int, string, pair, doesn't matter). The auto keyword is basically says compiler figure out what type of variable is in the data structure myMap. . You could just say for(int it: myMap) if you wanted to, most people just use auto. . For maps specifically, you can use this to get keys and values (if you're interested):. . . for (auto& [key, value]: myMap) {.     cout << key << "" has value "" << value << endl;. }. . Note the use of &. Here is does nothing other than save half a second from not copying itself, but what's important to note is that if you are planning on modifying an item using a range based for loop, you need to use the &, otherwise, you'll just be modifying a copy!"||0

lbh7neycmqn57v|One more attempt on autograder|Hello,. On the Project 5 autograder, I accidentally forgot to remove a line of code (#include 'Map.h') in my main file which led to the main.cpp file not being able to compile.

The error message specifically mentions a pointer being freed that was not allocated, which could indicate that you are trying to delete a null pointer.. One possible cause for this error could be that you are not properly checking for null pointers before attempting to delete them in your destroyNodes() function. You should make sure to check for null pointers before calling delete on them to avoid this error.. Additionally, make sure that you are properly deallocating all dynamically allocated memory in your destroyNodes() function. This includes deleting all nodes in the tree, as well as any other dynamically allocated memory that is used in your implementation.. If you continue to encounter this error, you may want to consider using a debugging tool such as a memory profiler to help identify the specific cause of the error and to help you fix it.||0

lbfd23allml45f|question about break the sorting invariant.|Hi, I am still confused about how to break the sorting invariant and write test cases for that. Could you explain it to me? Thank you so much!|78|0|active|From https://eecs280staff.github.io/p5-ml/#sorting-invariant. . The sorting invariant says that everything to the left of a node is smaller, and everything to the right is bigger. This link has some invalid test cases that you can create. Basically, create a tree in which something is bigger to the left of a node or smaller to the right.. . One way you can do this is by making a tree, inserting nodes, and then changing one to make it wrong.. So if you made a tree like this:. . You could make an iterator at the beginning of the tree, and then change it to 3. Then run check_sorting_invariant and see if it catches it. It would be invalid because two would be to the right, which is smaller than 3.. . Then if you wanted to change the next node, you can do ++ on the iterator and it will go to the next highest #.||0

For each Piazza post in the testing set, you want to calculate the log probability for each label in the training set. For example, in test_small, you want to test each test post for both euchre and calculator, the labels from the training set.. . The log probability, as shown in the equation above, is ln P(C), plus ln P(w | C) for each word in the test post.. . Look at the link above, but you calculate ln P(C) (log prior), then add ln P(w | c) (log likelihood) for each word.. . So for the test post:. ""my code segfaults when bob is the dealer"". . Do ln (P | C) once, then do ln P(w | C) for each of the words: my, code, segfaults, when, bob, is, the, dealer. Remember that it's for unique words, so you don't want to do the same word twice. But then add them all up, and you'll get your score for a given tag. Then see which score is highest for all of the tags, and whichever tag that was is your predicted label.. . So if you get -20 for calculator, and -12 for euchre, -12 is higher so you'd predict euchre. Does that help at all?. "||1

A linear recursive call can be tail recursive. so for example [return function(n-1)] is tail recursive while [return function(n-1) + 1] and [return function(n-1) + function(n-2)] are not, as there are other things in the return statement.||0

A linear recursive function is a function that makes at most 1 recursive call to itself.. . A tail recursive function must first be linear recursive, and in addition the recursive call must be the last piece of computational 'work' in the body of the function.

lba7bg6qzun7ii|Insert Function|Hello,. . I have been able to take in a cvstream and locate the tag's of euchre and calculator as well as the contents of all of the posts, but when I use a for range based for loop to insert these values into a map, for some reason the insert function is not working and does not add my desired contents into the map. . .

lb73sajmlot1|Log probability calculation|I've stored the training info into private ints/maps in my ADT, but I'm a bit unsure of how to proceed to the log probability calculations from here. My initial thought is to use a range-based for loop to iterate through the map of labels generated through training. Then, to iterate through the unique words in a test post and sum up the log likelihoods to ultimately get the log probability score of that label. I could then store the log probability scores for each label in another map. Is this a feasible approach?|204|0|active|This sounds feasible, but you don't need to store the log-probability scores for all labels in another map.

From https://eecs280staff.github.io/p5-ml/#efficiency:. . > Some common causes of slowdown you should avoid: Iterating over a map to find something rather than using `[]` or `find()`.. . You should be storing this data in a `std::map`, with the key being the word and the value being the number of posts.

One idea we had, although it seems like a very bad one, was to concatenate every string together (with a space on the end of each line) and then use our code below, so we don't have any repeats.

Help is needed and massively appreciated. . uniqname: billyin|5|0|private|You can actually check the sorting invariant function using iterators. If you create a complete, correct tree, you can change one of the correct values to an incorrect value using an iterator. This is because iterators point to the nodes themselves so by dereferencing them, you can change the value.. . Hope this helps!||0
lb42kmr2ks4769|using min and max in check sorting invariant|Hi, I was a little bit confused on how/when to use min and max within check sorting invariant. Any help would be much appreciated!|99|1|active|Great question!. . Our sorting invariant says that every element on the left side of a node MUST be lower than it. Every element on the right side of a node MUST be greater than it. One way to make sure of this is to find the maximum value on node->left. If it the maximum value in the left sub tree is greater than the root, we know that there is a value greater than the node on the left which breaks the sorting invariant. The same logic can be applied to the right side. If the minimum value in the right sub tree is less than the root, we know that there is a value to the right of the node that is less than the node which also breaks the sorting invariant.. . This same logic should be applied to the tree recursion. Think about if we had a tree like this and what your function would need to do.. . 6 .   \.     8.   /   \. 9      10. . Notice that just checking the left and right of the root won't catch the break in the sorting invariant. Hope this helps!||0

I really can't figure out any patterns here and I'm also not sure if it's an indented use case either.  Any insight would be much appreciated. |65|0|active|"From what you are showing, this actually looks like expected behavior. Remember that post-incrementing actually returns the value from before the increment. For example, if a = 1, ""cout << a++ << endl"" will print 1, but a will then be updated to equal 2.. . ++++iter should increment iter twice.. . iter++++ first performs iter++, which returns iter and then increments it. The second postfix increment is then performed on whatever iter++ returned, which is just whatever it already was without the increment. Therefore, the second increment is also just equivalent to doing iter++, and in the end, it will only increment once.. . ++++iter++++ increments iter twice (with ++++iter) and then once (with iter++++)."||2

lb2yyua8h6ghu|check_sorting_invariant()|In my test cases when using an iterator to break the invariant, the check_sorting_invariant function is never returning false. I realized that it has to do with how I use the max and min functions in check_sorting_invariant_impl, but I'm unsure of how to fix it. For example, right now I'm trying to find the max element of the left subtree, and see if it is greater than the root node. Say I have a tree that inserts 5, 4, and then 3, and then to break the sorting invariant, I change the 3 to a 6. However, if there is no right subtree, my max function just returns the root node, since in a valid tree, this would be the greatest node. So, it would never catch that 6 is the max element and that the sorting invariant has been broken. I'm not sure what to do, any recommendations?|158|1|active|Call max/min on subtrees and make sure check_sorting is recursive..

Lets say I have 5 as the root node, and I change a value on the right tree from 7, to 1. This works fine for my check_Sorting_invariant, but when I try to utilize the find function (looking for 1) to change it back to 7, my find function doesn't check the right tree for it since it assumes the BSH is following the proper sorting invariant.

lawtvasx97g5ia|About return of insert()|Hello, I wonder why the following test case is false positive.. . . BinarySearchTree<int> tree;. ASSERT_TRUE(tree.insert(3) == tree.begin());. ASSERT_TRUE(tree.insert(1) == tree.min_element());. . . My understanding is that since insert() returns find(item), it returns an Iterator to the item just inserted. begin() and min_element also return an Iterator to the minimum item in the tree if it is not empty. Thank you!. |253|0|active|So what you are doing here is you are comparing the node pointer iterator returned by the insert function to the iterator returned by the begin() function. This might cause a mismatch even if the underlying data at those iterators you are trying to compare are the same, hence the false positive. ||1

latqqde7tkvck|Accessing data in a tree|Say I had a tree with a root node of value 5, with its left node being 1 and it's right node being 7, with 7 having a left node with a value of 4. This would not follow the sorting invariant because 4 < 5 and it is in 5's right subtree. How would I correctly check that this follows the sorting invariant without saving the root node's data? When I use recursion to test if it follows the sorting invariant, it returns true because 4 is less than 7. |188|0|active|For example, in your case, when you compare the value of the current node (5) with values on the right subtree (7 and 4), you care about the minimum value of the right subtree (4) instead of the the value of the direct right subtree (7). You have other functions that can help you find the minimum value of the right subtree. For the left subtree, the checking process should be similar to how you check the right subtree.||1

You can recursively edit an entire branch of a tree, and still return the original node. In the case there an empty tree, it would go straight to the Base case and return that instead.

One compile error I had was 'operator()' is a private member of 'Map<std::string, double>::PairComp' when I tried to use the less() function in BinarySearchTree.h. Since PairComp is private in the map class, shouldn't BinarySearchTree needs to be a friend class of Map? (but we cannot change the interface so I'm a little confused):. . . I also had a compile error on the insert function for map. In the ""HINT:"" part of the comments for the insert function, it stated to use {k, Value_type()}, to create the element, which I took literally, unless it was suggesting we use V(), but either way I'm a little confused on how declaring the value works here.. . . Finally I had a compile error when using my find function in the BinarySearchTree class. For the find and [] operator map functions, we only pass in the key value to compare, so does this mean we need to make multiple [] overloaded operators in the PairCompare class, to support comparing two Pairs and two Keys? Currently I only have one operator comparing two Pairs (using Keycompare(p1.first, p2.first)), but this does not support directly having two keys for comparison. I'm a little confused because the spec just says we need an operator that takes in two pair types for [] operator, and nothing about one that compares two keys directly.. .

Shouldn't it be returning an iterator to the root?|146|0|active|"You should implement it as required which returns an iterator to the min value. For the meaning, for example, we may want a structure of sorted numbers, and under the hood, we may use binary search tree to store them. Then in this case, if the users want to iterate through the entire structure, it would be reasonable to start from the minimum value (since the user doesn't care what is at the ""root"")."||0
lakjaf6g3j638i|BST public test|"When I'm running the public test on my implementations, I'm getting an infinite loop when the test has ""cout << tree << endl << endl;"" Isn't this the function at the bottom of the h file that is already implemented for us and we can't change it? I'm just confused as to how to fix this without changing the given implementation. Thanks!"|196|1|active|Although this function is implemented for you, it uses a for each loop through the BST data structure which will look for an iterator implementation within the class. In order to iterate through the list, it will use the Iterator ++ operator to move through the BST. I would take a look at the implementation provided for this operator, and see which functions from your implementation it calls. One of these functions (that you implemented) called by the ++ operator is most likely causing the infinite recursion.||0
lakib8yle3x5xl|greater than function|I'm stuck on the greater than function because of the linear recursion. for my else {, i decided if its left or right then i called the min_greater_than_impl on that specific node but when I do it, it's not saving the last number before the null pointer so I don't know what specific modifications I have to make to not have the function go all the way back and just return its value at hand.|117|0|active|Marking as resolved.

lakf5epxejs4a4|check_sorting_invariant|Hello,. . I was watching the BST.h walk through video and I have a follow-up question for the Claire's explanation of the check_sorting_invariant implementation. She mentions that we should be using a function to check if the entire left sub tree is less than a root, and the entire right sub tree is greater than a root. I assume she is referring to the min_element and max_element functions, but those require that the tree is already properly sorted, right? Should I find another way check the entire sub tree?. . Thanks for the help.|7|0|private|Nope you should use the min_element and max_element functions||0
lakelckmq9n5g5|Insert|Hi,. I was just curious how to approach the insert function. I am a bit lost on how to go about it. |226|0|active|Essentially you want to find a null node to place the new node to that still maintains the sorting of the bst. So what should your base case be and what should you do in the base case? Think about when you want to return a new Node. Also look at the return type of insert_impl. Does that give you a hint on what you should be returning in your base case?. . How do you know if you should place this node on the left of Node* node or the right of it? You can use the less() comparator. In the case that your item is less than the node, you should be adding the new Node on the left side, and vice versa for the right side. . . Hope this helps!||0

lak3q2f3riw2ka|base case not evaluating to true|In the public test case, the program calls size() on a tree with one node. After recursing both right and left(which are both null pointers), the program runs into a problem. Although left and right are both null, the base case does not evaluate to true and the program tries to recurse when there is no node available to recurse with, leading to undefined behavior.. . I have tried making the base case !node, node==nullptr, and empty_impl(node). Every time, the base case if() statement never evaluates to true. . . What could be causing this?|101|1|active|If node is a nullptr, !node, node == nullptr, empty_impl(node) should all give you true. Did you make clean and remake the executables after you changed the files? If not, you would still use the old version of your code.||0

lajyi9upf9169p|Iterator testing|I'm a little bit confused about the implementations here. In P4, we could directly make an iterator outside of list and use it to call the Iterator functions on list.

For example, in Map.h we have the following line:. . . using Iterator = typename BinarySearchTree<Pair_type, PairComp>::Iterator;. . This line just makes an alias typename for a BST iterator for you to use in Map.h outside of the BST module. I'm not quite sure if I understand what you mean by ""call iterator functions"", but you can use all of the functionality defined for Iterators in BST.h such as *, ++, ==, and !=.. "||0

laixxw2bnt07pk|Base case|Hi, . I was just curious what is the right way to approach a base case that is the root of an entire bst. I know (!node) refers to an empty tree. However, how do I call a base case on the root of the tree? Or is it assumed in many functions where node is passed in that node will always be the root |114|0|active|Our functions are written such that we do assume that the `node` passed into each function is the base or root of a tree. A good way to think of base cases is to think of the most simple trees. An empty tree, like you named, is a good one. A tree with just one element could also be worth considering.. . Find the easiest version of the problem to solve, solve it (base case), and then just tell the computer to keep solving it (recursion).||0

I am using less now like less(*node,val) where I want it to return (node->datum "|134|2|active|I'd have to look more at the code, but a few things:. . 1. You have to use `node->datum`, not `*node`, when passing into `less`. The former is of type `T` while the latter is of type `Node`.. 2. Be sure that you're calling it correctly and not accidentally passing it into another function. For example, don't do something like `max_element_impl(less(node->datum, val))` as that would not compile.||0

lahhfbvfbp05le|Checking for Representation Invariants|Do we need to check for no duplicates and sorting invariants at the beginning of each function? Since BinarySearchTree.h states that they can be considered part of the requires clause, should we be using assert for these invariants? Also, it says that our member function implementations must ensure the invariants hold when they are finished executing. Is that something we should explicitly check with assert or just write our code in a way that will not result in violating the invariants?|202|1|active|No you do not need to check the sorting invariant in each function. You do not need to add asserts for it. We add it into the requires clause to say that you can assume the tree passed in follows the invariants. Hope this helps!||0
