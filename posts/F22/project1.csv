l8c0lm1vczfzm|Project 1 private tests|Hi,. . Just a piece of feedback to the course as a student. The general point of assignments, (exams, projects, HW, etc.) is to test my learning and see where I'm lacking so that I can improve. If I did something wrong, I want to understand why it is wrong and what I should've done instead. In the case of private tests, I just know that I did something wrong. Not why or how it was wrong. Without this information, I'm not sure how to improve and not make the same mistake in the future.. . I get that it's policy that's been in place for years, but I feel like it's counterintuitive to be unable to learn from my mistakes. Also, I am not just mad or angry about P1, I only lost 1 point in the private tests which I am perfectly fine with. I just felt like sharing my thoughts because it is frustrating to know that I am wrong and not know why, and I'm sure that I will experience the same feelings in the future. . . Thanks for your time. |5|0|private|Hi Sumer! I totally understand wanting to learn from your mistakes and continuously improve on your coding skills. We keep the private tests hidden so that they aren't shared with next semester's students which makes them not so private.. . You are allowed to come to office hours, specifically office hours with a professor and ask about why you lost points. Some staff members and most of the professors should be able to give you that information. So please come to office hours! You will definitely be able to get feedback!||0

l83v2kgbzfs3lz|Autograder result|Hello! I just saw the results of my private tests, which turned out to be 20/24. I don't understand why simple functions such as sum and count failed. I would really appreciate it if I can get some insight on why there were such errors on the autograder.|20|0|private|I noticed you didn't have any test cases for sum() in your submitted code. Although it might seem like some functions are trivial, bugs can be very subtle and the only way to be sure they work as expected is to test them with a variety of input.. . I would recommend writing a few diverse test cases and see if you can replicated the bug on your end. As a hint, I believe your function will produce the correct output for a vector like {2,-1,0}. What are other types of values you can try passing in? Think about the data type being passed in.. . For count, you are missing an edge case. Hint: take a look at the RME for count. What is different compared to most of the other functions?. . Feel free to drop by office hours if you want to discuss writing thorough test cases.||1

l83e2oqat5otx|project 1 - summarize tests|Hi, on my end the summarize function worked but on the autograder it failed both tests -- can someone please clarify what was wrong thru autograder? uniqname is ekahrem|107|0|active|"I believe you had some out-of-bounds errors, where you attempted to access an element within a vector at an invalid index. Always be careful and remember that indices are only valid in the range of 0 - (size - 1). If you would want some further clarification with this, feel free to come to office hours!. . (Kevin) Adding to Tyler's answer: it's possible that in your local environment, you had old data leftover that you were ""successfully"" able to index into. The autograder basically cleans and resets memory so that everyone's tests are evaluated in the same conditions, which could be why it worked locally but not on autograder. For future reference, this is what CAEN is for - CAEN has the same environment as the autograder and will help you catch issues like this."||0

The last element is not being pushed to the vector.. . - for the first pair of data, the frequency will automatically adding 1 itself. . You initialize count to 1 and begin the for loop at the first element. So you basically compare the first element with itself so `count` will always be incremented by 1 at the beginning.. .

My code runs every type of test I put in, including tests with repeating numbers, etc. I can't figure out what part of my summarize function is causing this (I've messed with the for loops). . . Edit: apparently the UB checks don't really matter (?) but it's for my sanity and knowledge. Could someone check my code?|85|0|active|Double check that the bounds on your loops are correct in the summarize function (specifically, I would take a look at your inner loop that counts repeating numbers).

l826bojjpzy1r6|percentile - overindexing and starting from index 0|Hi, what specifically in the percentile formula is causing it to index from 1? Is it the +1 in rank? I am trying to figure out how to avoid overindexing. thanks!|66|0|active|These posts should help you with this: @523 @519. . The reason why you have to deal with overindexing is because the formula uses the value of k+1 (consider whether there is an input that will yield a value k that lets you go out-of-bounds).||0

It seems like your main.cpp just doesn't print the information in the correct way. As you can see, line 5 should be ""6: 1"". And it looks like you aren't calling/printing the summary function correctly as you're missing the frequency for 10.. 2. It's certainly possible that your functions pass your unit tests as well as the public_test if these tests just aren't targeting what your function's weakness/error is. It's possible to pass the public tests but fail the main output here. You might just have to look closer at your mode function.. . For future formatting issues with autograder, it's helpful as well to click the show whitespace button so you can see exactly where spaces / newlines are missing."||0

I'm kind of betting it's my percentile function.. . Thanks!. . uniqname is wjrob|9|0|private|Your output looks great, but your program is exiting with code 1. This is because your main function in main.cpp is returning 1. As a convention, programs return an exit code of 0 if they run without error, and return a non-zero exit code if they encounter an error. So even though your program is running just fine, it's tricking the autograder into thinking there's an error by returning 1.. This has an easy fix: If your program makes it all the way to the end without error, it should return 0. Hope this helps!||0

I'm trying to solve this by changing ""k < v.size()"" to ""k <= v.size()"" but the second I do that, it causes a buffer overflow. Would anybody be able to explain to me why this happens and what I can do about it?. . Thanks guys.. . . . "|9|0|private|Recall that vectors (and arrays, for that matter) are indexed starting from 0 in C/C++. So if you have a vector v with five elements in it, v.size() returns 5, and you can access indices 0 through 4. In the last iteration of your for-loop, k is equal to v.size(), which is one position after the last index, hence the buffer overflow.. I see what you mean about your code skipping the last entry in the summary. Consider tracing this example: v = [1, 2, 3]. In the last iteration of your for-loop, you add the summary for 2, but you never get the chance to for 3. Maybe you need some logic outside the loop? Hope this helps!||0

To ensure that your code is robust, test it with your own test cases, to see where the bugs are. You can keep submitting even past your 3 graded submits, since you already have 9/9, the feedback provided by these 3 submissions are not valuable to you, so they might as well not be there at all (to be clear, I just mean that you should submit at long as you think you have worked out another bug). The autograder will use the best result that you ever submitted, regardless of if you submitted broken ones afterwards. It's possible that your code is great, and there are no issues. It is more likely that there are bugs, so keep working on unit tests until you are satisfied with your code's performance. ||1

How do I solve this?. autogradererr.png|92|0|active|The student is correct, that junk value is likely the output of a variable that has not been initialized. Also be careful that you are not printing i in a loop (i is simply a value that increments) but rather the values within your actual result vector. It also looks like your output is giving you an out of range error. I would run your debugger and ensure that your summarize function returns the correct vector by looking in the side variables panel. If that is correct then you can step through how you are printing it and see why you are printing that junk value. . . . ||1

l80jqp1128y3g6|autograder being weird regarding percentile|Hello, so my program outputs the correct numbers however the autograder is still not giving me the point for the main public test. The only difference I see in the expected output and the program output is the amount of whitespace around some of the outputs for percentile. Is that what is causing it and is this what they mean by the autograder will grade based on styling?. . Also does it matter that instead of having the formula calculate when it is given the 0th percentile and 100th percentile, I just have an if else if else where it outputs the largest number of the sorted vector for 100th, smallest for 0th and calculates it for all of the others?. . |170|0|active|If we provide you sample output, it can be helpful to compare your own output against our sample file on some sort of diff checker or using the handy diff command in your command line to easily see if there is any difference. . ||1

Thanks so much|13|0|private|Instead of lines where you are calculating the int (k) and decimal (d) values, I recommend using the modf function in the spec to avoid any issues with splitting the rank (n) value into its respective parts. . . Also, on the line where you are calculating percentile, remember that the formula given to us on Wikipedia operates on 1 indexing logic and we need to modify it to be 0 indexed. . . Lastly, I would take a look at the RME at what the p value should be. You're treating it as a whole number, but it specifies that the p value will be between 0 and 1 inclusive  ||1

E.g.:. . . vector<double> get_special_vector() {.  return /* some vector */;. }. . although if you are using long enough vectors that reusing them is a pain, it might be worth rethinking your test cases. Remember that the small scope hypothesis says we should be able to expose any meaningful bug with a small test case (for this project, I don't think you should ever need more than 5 elements).

Do I just type out multiple test scenarios?)How exactly is the grading done on testing? If my methods work out with not much testing done, would I still get full credit? |146|0|active|"A good tip is to make your test cases as succinct as possible, and to test ""edge"" cases (like passing in vectors of length one, etc). In the stats_tests.cpp file, you can write a bunch of functions each testing a different function in stats.cpp, and use one or more assert statements to check the output of your functions against what you expect the output to be. Once you also put function calls for your tests within main() in stats_tests.cpp, running ""make stats_tests.exe"" should compile and run your tests as well as the public tests provided."||1

See https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_make.html#compile-with-make, because it is preconfigured and you don't need to type the long command.. . The reason your assert function fails is because `count(v) == 3 ` is false, which means that `count(v)` returns a value that is not equal to 3. That's how you catch bugs by writing test functions. To go from here, check your `count()` function more carefully. I took a look at your code on Autograder, and the `count()` function always returns zero (so are the other functions in `stats.cpp`. You only `cout` the values, but you need to return them). I'm not sure if you have fixed that, but that's the cause of the problem in the screenshot.||1

Considering the autograder has private test cases you can't see until after the submission deadline, this is a common concern.

However, if you've been scoring so well on your submissions so far, I can confidently say that you'll be okay. Even if you do lose a few points, those are points to learn from! . . As for coming up with edge cases for your code, I'd recommend taking a look at the range of input values in the descriptions of your function.

It exposes certain other issues with code like undefined behavior. I just want to clarify that even though you got full points on the public cases on the Autograder, does not mean your code is working perfectly. You should definitely write your own test cases and run your code in CAEN to ensure that you don't have any bugs. The test cases on the autograder are very basic and do not encompass all edge cases. There's a CAEN tutorial on the eecs 280 website that will be helpful for how to navigate CAEN on mac! ||0

My guess is that that is where the error is coming from. If it wasn't that, maybe these: did you type `vector = {current_num, count};`, or `vector example_name = {current_num, count};` (`int` vs `double` not relevant here)? Maybe try initializing it with an actual number then use your variables. Hope this helps!!! :)||0

Some insight would be appreciated.. 1.png. 2.png. 3.png. 4.png|18|0|private|Hi! This is a great question. On the autograder, your test functions are tested against other buggy code to see if you catch errors. Unfortunately, getting all of the test points on autograder doesn't mean your code actually passes them. You'd have to run your stats_tests.cpp locally to test your code. . . I think you're right on track in terms of looking for where the errors could be. In particular, I'd take a closer look at the spec for each of these functions. In particular, take note if the spec mentions anything about where your functions should start indexing from. . . This is a great question, and I think other students could benefit from seeing it. If you feel comfortable, feel free to make it public! You can still choose to keep it anonymous. Hope this helps!||2

This is my implementation of the summarize function in stats.cpp. This screenshot also has the error that I get after trying to run stats_tests.. |12|0|private|Hmm okay. Looking at `summarize` in `stats.cpp`, you're probably getting that specific issue on line 23 or line 28. `bigv[1]` refers to the second element of `bigv`, but `bigv` only has one element (one vector) in it on the first iteration of the for loop.. . I *think* (and I could be wrong) that you might be mixing things up with your vector indexes. If so, this might help. We provide an example in `stats.h` of an output summarize vector like so:. . ```. {.     {1, 2},.     {2, 3},.     {17, 1}. }. ```. . The entire object is of type `vector>`. There are three `vector` objects in here: `{1, 2}`, `{2, 3}`, `{17, 1}`. If we call our outer vector of vectors `v`, then we could access the second vector with `v[1]`. We can then index into the vector at `v[1]` with additional square brackets: `v[1][0] == 2` (first element of `v[1]`) and `v[1][1] == 3` (second element of `v[2]`). Going back a bit, `v[0]` accesses the first vector, `v[2] accesses the third vector.. .

No, you don't have to create an RME for the main function in main.cpp. You also don't need to have RMEs for your tests in stats_tests.cpp, but I think it's a good idea to write a short description of what the test is doing or something about the datasets that you are trying.

l7qy1o7389e3xf|Rand in Test cases?|Hi, . . I was wondering if test cases could make use of the rand function? Or, should every aspect of the test case be known to the programmer for debugging purposes? |141|0|active|The issue with using random data for test cases is: how are you going to know the correct answer for the random data? If you are going to check whether your function calculates the correct mean of a random set of data, you need to know what the correct mean is. If you try to write something to find the mean of this random data programmatically, well then congratulations you've written your function again, or a different function that you aren't sure works 100% of the time.. . This isn't to say that you can't - for example, you could find a `mean` function that has been verified to work accurately and use that to test against the random data. But when your function fails, it would be helpful to know the data where it failed so you could study why it failed at that specific case. You would test your function against that data until it works - and voila, you ended up using a static, known test case in the end.. . The randomness just helped you find that case by chance - but what if it didn't find an edge case for you? Your function wouldn't be completely correct and you wouldn't know it. It's better to think through and find your wanted test cases because you may have an intuition of what datasets your function may err on instead of trying to find one by picking at straws.. . tl;dr: it's hard to check your answer on a random dataset and random data probably isn't the best at finding where your function fails||0

If you plan to change a double’s value and then compare two that you expect to be identical, only then will you want an epsilon.

With your organization, if there is something wrong with, say, ""sum"", and everything else is fine, you may fail every test (which isn't very informative).

When you run the percentile function, many new variables are created. These variables access elements of the vector directly so they have to be in bounds of the vector size (aka 0 - vector size - 1).

It's also helpful to stop compile errors from occurring when you try to submit to the autograder.||1
l7gsez1xid83t1|Number of sigfigs to extend the functions to?|For some of the functions, particularly the percentage and standard deviation function, the outputs can result in some pretty long numbers. How many significant figures should our functions and test cases extend to in order to be accurate to the autograder?|261|2|active|As long as you are using the typical C++ \`double\` type for decimal numbers, your precision should not be an issue autograder-wise. Do note, however, this part of the spec for testing equality of decimals: [https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/#floating-point-comparisons](https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/#floating-point-comparisons) (you do not need to do `cout.precision()` or anything like that)||1
l7gs7fnyq2399|Summarize function|I’m starting the project and am working on the summarize function. can I use the extract_column function from p1_library? if I am able to do I need to include the #include “p1_library.h” in the stats.cpp file?|230|1|active|Yes, to use functions from a header file you must #include them||1
l7grokn48qs3h3|Sort Function|What does the sort function sort the vector by? is it from least to greatest or??|178|0|active|"As the student answer says, the provided `sort` function sorts the vector in ascending order.

l7gpo5sxatv43j|how to use csvstream|I see the constructor requires delimiter and strict, I was wondering what they are. I'm working on main.cpp, and I'm trying to read in files. |166|1|active|The `p1_library.h` has an `std::vector extract_column(std::string filename, std::string column_name)` function that does this for you. Putting `#include ` into any of your submitted files will cause the autograder to automatically reject your submission, so don't try to implement it yourself. Make sure to check the section that shows the libraries you're allowed to use for this project.||0
l7gpijz8z6d7j5|stdev for formula|Hi, I am working on stdev function, but I saw two stdev formula online, one use N as denominator, the other use n-1. I wonder do we need to consider the difference between population and sample or just use n-1 for this project? Thx.|11|0|private|You should use the sample standard deviation formula, which uses n-1.. . Edit: As a more direct answer, the RME for standard deviation asks specifically for the “corrected sample standard deviation”, which is given here in the wiki page:. ||0

l7gm022rjbt625|Error with checking is vector is empty|Hi I don't know if this is a dumb question but why is there an error here for return -1? . . . . . . Thanks|10|0|private|Remember that the return value must match the type that the function specifies. Here we can see that the function requires a 2d vector as a return value so returning -1 (an int) will throw a conversion error.||1

l7fjqwzctbd1a4|Median function project 1|For the median function required to implement in Project 1, can we use the sort function provided in p1_library.h to sort the vector and find the actual median, or are we trying to find the ninther as defined the wikipedia page?|179|0|active|You should use the `sort` function and compute the median as you normally would manually.||0
l7fjil9qj0v2bz|Issue with percentage formula|The formula for percentage goes:. $$rank = \frac{P}{100} (N-1) + 1 = k + d$$. $$v_p = v_k + d(v_{k+1}-v_k)$$. Say that P = 100. Then, k = N and we are trying to access $v_{N+1}$ in the 1-indexed system, which is out of bounds. Do we treat 100 percentile as 99 percentile?|233|6|active|Very good observation! Perhaps in that case using the formula isn't the best for P = 100. Perhaps there's another way to compute the 100th percentile...||0
