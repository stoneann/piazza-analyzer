lapm8hjrv3h1ry|A regrade request to regrade request|Hi Professors, I got my regrade decision saying I couldn't get the point back because I don't have const anywhere in the function header,. . However, this is what my function look like, which have the const at the end. This makes sure the no object will be manipulated right. If not, please correct me. . . Thanks.|8|0|private|Unfortunately, the const included at the end of your function header does not ensure that Fort objects one and two will not be modified. Declaring a function as const as you have done in your solution would typically be done for a member function, and would mean that the object on which the function is called cannot be modified by the function's execution, but does not prevent the modification of the parameters. ||0

la19sr71otd28p|Midterm Grading Question|On the exam, there were several instances in which I included the scope operator in my function headers and was deducted points for the reason that this wasn't explicitly needed. In the instructions, however, it wasn't explicitly stated that the functions should be written in the scope of the class, so I felt the scope operator should be included as there was some ambiguity. Why is this incorrect?|62|0|private|For at least the C-Style ADT's question, you're writing functions for a struct, not belonging to a class, which is why the scope resolution operator is incorrect there. I can't find anywhere else where you were deducted points for this. Could you point me to which questions those were? I'll also make this post private so we can discuss your exam answers.||1

la0i0r8s4us3br|Query on midterm provided solution|. . I got this question wrong.. . I get that the function `splice` would work fine without the requires clauses that I wrote, but the instructions explicitly state that the RME should have **any necessary restrictions for the operation implemented by the function to make sense**. They also state that **the REQUIRES clause should prohibit inputs that don't make sense**.. . I get that the function would work correctly without any REQUIRES lines. However, I don't think the inputs allowed in that case would make any sense! Specifically, why would anyone expect this function to work correctly on indexes less than 0? Or indexes greater than the length of the string?|177|0|active|The question says to not select any of the comments that are unnecessary. Since the function is intended to work with and properly handle values that would go against those requires clauses (as shown in the examples provided), they are unnecessary and therefore should not be selected.||0

This question did not explicitly state that the member initializer list should be used, and my code is functionally the same, so I was wondering why I got points deducted for this? (my answer is on the left and the correct is on the right)|204|0|active|I understand its frustrating loosing points over small things.

l9qim50zyws4su|Initialize reference with value|. . When we are calling banana in the main function, we are pasing *arr as the first parameter, which is 2 I think. So in the banana function, what the reference type c really gets is just literally the integer 2, which to my understanding is the same as. int &c = 2;. and I thought this to be a compiler error, since reference type cannot be initialized using just value. But why this piece of code does not have any error and functions right? Thanks!|13|0|private|Instead of thinking about it as int &c = 2, think about it as:int &c = *arr;c becomes a reference to *arr, or arr[0].||1

l9qc54zahcv24o|Following Precedent of Previous Question|Hello! I am working on a question about Polymorphism. In the first part of the question, I said that it was impossible to create an instance of one of the subclasses because it doesn't have an implementation for a pure virtual function defined in its base class. However, in the second part the question asks if all the different subclasses could be held in a vector with pointers of the base class type.

And in the opposite case if it says we can’t change any of the member variables in a class to implement a function, that function should be const for both base and derived classes right?. . 4.

What would happen if you used void tune override(last option in the code bank)for the base class(instrument) tune function? . . 4) For 7.3 can I say no compile error b/c trumpet is not an abstract data type(or is it abstract class?) since it has no pure virtual function and it has a play function so everything compiles?. . 5) for 7.4 can I say no compile error b/c at compile time the static type for the pointer is instrument and since instrument class does have a play function, it compiles?. . 6) Can I say for 7.5 it does  not compile because at compile time the static type for the inst ptr pointer is instrument and since instrument class doesn’t have num drums function it results in a compile error?. . 7) For 7.6 can I say no compile error b/c at compile time the static type for the pointer is instrument and since instrument class does have a play function, it compiles?. . 8) For 7.7 can I say it does not compile b/c the line where horn ptr is assigned to inst ptr is an implicit downcast since when you read from right to left it’s saying that an instrument is a horn which is wrong? |122|0|active|1. The tune function should not be const because it alters member variables of classes that require tuning. A function should be declared const when it is not supposed to changed any member variables to ensure that the function actually does not change any variables.. . 2. Const override just means that a const function is being overriden. You use it to override a const virtual function.. . 3. Yes the virtual keyword is necessary. If you do not use the virtual keyword, then the function will use static binding when it is called. This means that if you use an instrument pointer pointing to a horn object and call the function (without the virtual keyword), it will call the instrument version of the function rather than the horn version of the function.. . 4. yes. . 5. This code compiles because the instrument pointer points to a drum, which is not an abstract class, and the pointer is used to call a function that is defined in the instrument class.||0

If you include a const modifier in the parent function, the children functions must also include const in the header or else it won’t correctly override the functions. And if we include const in the children functions, we cannot modify member variables like we want to.7.2 will compile because it overrides the pure virtual function in Instrument, and thus you can create a horn object and call play.The virtual keyword signifies a function may be called differently based on its dynamic and static type.

Is it because Toy does not have an introduce function?. |51|0|active|That is precisely correct. In this case, it doesn't matter static or dynamic type since a Toy object simply doesn't have that function defined.. . For further reasoning on this, consider a toy pointer that points to a Toy object. This Toy object doesn't have the introduce() function, so it would trivially error when compiled.

The only time you want to use a pointer when creating an array is a case such as  char *a = new char[6] - it's because the compiler doesn't need to worry about ""preparing"" the space in advanced like it does with char a[6]..

l9ox1i6syz31g3|const vs non const|How do const and non const interact with each other?|45|0|active|Generally, the rule of thumb is that you can always make something `more` const than the original but not less `const`.. . # Variables. If you are passing variables by value, there should be no issues, since everything is copied by value:. ```cpp. //works!. int a = 0;. void func(const int b) {};. func(a);. const int b = a;. . //works!. const int a = 0;. void func(int b) {}. func(a);. int b = a;. . //fails to compile. // you can only assign `const` a value when you initialize it. const int a;. int b = 0. a = b;. ```. . If you are passing by reference, you can always make something more `const` but never less `const`:. ```cpp. //works!. int a = 0;. void func(const int&b) {}. func(a);. const int &b = a;. . //fails to compile. const int a = 0;. void func(int &b) {}. func(a);. int&b = a;. ```. . Similarly with pointers, you can make a pointer more `const` but not less `const` than the original:. . ```cpp. //works!. int a = 0;. const int* b = &a;. . //fails to compile. const int a = 0;. int* b = &a;. ```. . # Class Functions. Class functions declared as `const` will not modify the class. Therefore, all the class functions that these functions call must be `const` as well. Functions that are not declared as `const` can call `const` functions though.. . ```cpp. class a {. 	void const_func() const {}. 	void other_const_func() const {}. 	void nonconst_func() {}. };. . void a::const_func() const {. 	//works!. 	other_const_func();. 	//fails to compile. 	nonconst_func();. }. . void a::nonconst_func() {. 	//works!. 	const_func();. 	other_const_func();. }. ```. .

Also, in the solution for 4.2, how does while(getline(in, line)) work? How would getline(in, line) evaluate to a boolean?. . Here is my solution:. |63|1|active|Your solution is close to correct. When each line is reached, your solution first extracts the first word from that line into `word`, which _moves the internal cursor of `in` past that word_. You then read the rest of the line into `cur`, trim it, and write it to `out`. As a result, the first word of each line never gets written to `out`.. . The way `getline(...)` evaluates to a bool is the same as how `is >> word` evaluates to a bool. Both expressions have the type `istream&`, a reference to an input stream. When we put this expression in the condition of an `if` statement, we implicitly call [operator bool()](https://cplusplus.com/reference/ios/ios/operator_bool/), which evaluates to `true` if the last extraction took place successfully and the stream is open. After reading each line successfully, the resulting stream evaluates to `true`, but as soon as we try to read beyond the end of the input stream (e.g. file), the fail bit gets set, so the resulting stream evaluates to `false`, which prompts us to exit the loop and stop trying to read from `in`.||0

l9notixwur076a|Should we consider using uninitialized variables as runtime error or compile-time error?|I'm not 100% sure about this. Here's my thought. If we have uninitialized primitive types, there might be memory junks so that the program can actually run but output some random stuff. So, this should be an undefined runtime error.. If we have uninitialized objects, then the compiler will report the error. So, this should be a compile-time error.. Am I right?. Or can we consider both of them to be compile time error?|69|1|active|**TLDR: It depends.**. . The compiler (both gcc and clang) _is able to_ look out for reads from uninitialized variables _when you ask it to_. To do so, pass `-Wall` or `-Wuninitialized` as a command line argument to `gcc` or `clang`, which signals the compiler to warn you about usages of uninitialized variables. If you additionally pass `-Werror`, the compiler turns these warnings into errors that prevent the program from being compiled.. . According to Project 3's Makefile, we enable all these warnings and turn them into errors by default, so putting this uninitialized usage in Project 3 results in a compile-time error. However, one could definitely argue that the nature of this error is more runtime-oriented. For example, the memory sanitizer from both gcc and clang report this problem at runtime.||0

l9nnfliz89tr3|why does this print nothing|cout << argv[3] + 1 << endl;. . when command. ./program.exe cat dog 2 3 . is run in main. |53|0|active|"You're trying to add a c-string to an integer, which isn't what you want to do. argv[3] is pointing to the string ""2"". When you call argv[3] it actually decays into a pointer, pointing to the first character of the string (which cout knows to ""expand"" to the full string to the null terminator). So argv[3] + 1 is actually pointing to the second character in the string, being \0. That's why it's printing nothing - because it reaches the null terminator immediately and just stops because it thinks it reached the end of the string. This can be better illustrated by passing in 21 for example instead of 2 - argv[3] + 1 should then print out just ""1"".. . What you actually want to do is atoi(argv[3]) + 1 - atoi converts the string into an integer, which you can add 1 to freely. atoi comes from <cstdlib>."||0

l9nncx0rbxw7mm|constant struct|What is the syntax for making a struct constant? If we make a struct constant, does it mean all members are constant? Also, what 's the difference between void foo(Person const &p) and void foo(Person &p constant) and void foo(Person & constant p )? Thank you!|40|0|active|"If you have a `const` struct, then all the internal variables will be held constant. Note, however, that you cannot use `const` while defining the struct:. ```cpp. // cannot do this. const struct Animal {. 	string name;. 	int claws;. };. ```. . You can only use `const` when describing individual elements or variables. So you can do this:. ```cpp. const Animal lobsta {""lobster"", 2};. // now you can't change the name or claws of lobsta. // the following line will cause a crash. lobsta.claws = 4;. ```. . As for your second question. The `const` keyword has a priority in what it makes constant:. 1. the keyword to the left of it. 2. the keyword to the right of it. . - `void foo(Person const &p)`. Here, to the left of `const` is `Person`, which means that you cannot modify the variables of `p` at all, since this would be changing the `Person` object that `p` is linked to. For example, `p.age = 2` would crash. This is also the same as if you said `void foo(const Person &p)`. - `void foo(Person &p const)`. This wouldn't compile, `const` has to be near a keyword since it makes this part of the variable definition constant. Here, the symbol directly to the left of the `const` is just the variable name and to the right is just a closing parenthesis.. - `void foo(Person & const p)`. This doesn't compile either, but if it did it wouldn't have much use. Here, the `const` would be telling the computer that the `&` part of the variable `p` can't be changed, saying that `p` cannot be changed to a reference to another object. However, this is already a property of all reference variables. Maybe you're confusing it with a similar structure using pointers:. - `void foo(Person * const p)`. Here, the `const` tells the computer that the `*` part of the type is constant, so you cannot change which object `p` points to. But you will be able to change the object itself.. .

l9nm9mbsxz41ch|Spring 2019 midterm 0b) 3|May I ask why problem 3 is undefined? I ran this in lobster, and it shows that result is 3. . |71|0|active|Because `apple()` has the integer parameter `a` passed by value, the value passed in at the function call will literally be copied to a new variable `a` inside the function. `apple()` returns the address to `a`, and then `a`'s memory is deallocated from the stack once `apple()` finishes running. . . So when you `cout` `*z`, it is trying to print the value that `z` points to, whose memory has been deallocated. This means it is free to be used by the program for other uses, and we have no idea what value might be stored in there. Sometimes the 3 will still be there, sometimes it won't.||0

Also, if I add another non-const reference to x, will it makes a change? for instance, int &ref2 = x; Thank you so much!|31|1|active|The const only applies to the thing itself. So in your example, if you did x = 5 - the value of ref would also be updated to be 5.

l9nj2a0myvu619|understanding override and overload|. I understand chick. weight() overrides the virtual weight function in chicken since chick's weight() is inherently virtual.. Is virtual weight function in chicken overloading the weight function in Bird since it has virtual?. |51|0|active|"I think you are confusing the terms override and overload.. Overloading has nothing to do with inheritance. Overloading is simply when you define multiple functions with the same name, but different parameters. This can be outside a class, inside a single class, etc.. . Overriding is when a function in a derived class has the same function signature (name, parameters, const/not const, everything) as the function in the base class. The virtual keyword is not needed for overriding functions. Chick::weight() overrides Chicken::weight(), which overrides Bird::weight(). Calling the weight() function for an object will run the most specific / accurate one. . . The reason we use the virtual keyword is that we often want to use pointers. Virtualness allows for us to program with the principles of polymorphism. C++ by default will call the function associated with the ""static type"" of the pointer. Example: without the virtual keyword on Chicken::weight(), chickenPtr->weight() will call Chicken::weight() even if the actual value pointed to is a Chick.. . If a function does have the virtual keyword, then it will check to see what the ""dynamic type"" of the object the pointer is pointing to. So in this case, with a chickenPtr (pointing to a Chick), chickenPtr->weight() will make the program say ""hmm let's see... chickenPtr points to a Chick. I should call Chick::weight() instead"". . .

We use the scope resolution operator when we want to specify which version of the function to use (in case Phone had it's own deletePower() function).

Since the null character is still a character and exists inside the array, it still has a memory address.

l9lsoweg6my3ua|Spring 2016 Midterm Question 2b|For question 2b part d, I was confused as to why there would be no output for this line. I know that the 2 from argv[3] would still be a C-style string, meaning that 1 cannot be added to it, but I'm confused as to why there's no output rather than having 2 + 1 as the output.. |87|0|active|You *can* add 1 to `argv[3]` because `argv[3]` is a C-style string that will decay into a pointer. So you're just doing pointer arithmetic.. . The actual C-string at `argv[3]` looks like this:. . ```{ '3', '\0' }```. . When we `cout` a C-style string, we print up until we see a null terminator character `\0`. In this case, `argv[3] + 1` gives you a pointer to the `\0` element in this array. When `argv[3] + 1` is passed to `cout`, it will print everything up to the `\0` character -- but since it starts with a `\0`, it just prints nothing (because there is nothing in the C-style string preceding the null terminator).. .

Thx! . |105|0|active|"This one is pretty tricky, so I'll walk through what my logic was for this problem.. . First look at the new Triangle class:. ```. class Triangle : public Instrument {. public:.   Triangle() { cout << ""Triangle ctor"" << endl; }. .   virtual void play() { cout << ""ting ting ting!"" << endl; }.   bool is_loud() { return true; }. };. ```. Notice there is no `Triangle::tune()`, function, and yet in the given code, we have:. ```. Instrument* ptr;. .... ptr = ▵. ptr->tune(); // prints ""This instrument does not require tuning."". ```. Because this line actually prints something, we know that `Instrument::tune()` cannot be virtual, as `ptr->tune()` will realize there is no `Triangle::tune()` function and will default to calling `Instrument::tune()`. We can therefore conclude that the box for `Instrument::tune()` should contain:. ```. virtual void tune() {.   cout << ""This instrument does not require tuning."" << endl;. }. ```. (We need the `virtual` keyword because the other classes derive from it with their own implementations.). The drum object prints the same thing as that for triangle, so we know it too doesn't need its own `tune()` function as it will default to `Instrument`. We know we need a `Horn::tune()` function because it prints something different than `Instrument::tune()`. Since `Trumpet::tune()` prints the same thing as `Horn::tune()`, we don't need a `Trumpet::tune()` function as it will just default to `Horn::tune()`."||1

l9lk2ugdg5o3jt|Use of const keyword in functions|I was confused about the different ways that const is used in functions.

Also, when a function returns a const value (as shown below), does this mean that if I assign a variable to the value that the function returns, does this variable have to be const as well?. . When a member function is declared const, can the function only be called on const objects?|46|0|active|. if the parameters of a function are const (as shown below), then does the object that is passed into the function have to be const as well?. . In this example, the matrices passed in don't have to be const themselves. Instead, we are passing in const references to the matrix objects; these references allow us to refer to the original objects (i.e. we don't have to copy them) but don't allow us to modify the original matrix object using the reference.. . . when a function returns a const value (as shown below), does this mean that if I assign a variable to the value that the function returns, does this variable have to be const as well?. . Yes. In your example, you must save the returned value into a const int pointer; if you try to save it into a regular int pointer, you'll get a compiler error about trying to convert from non-const to const.. . . When a member function is declared const, can the function only be called on const objects?. . No, you can call const functions on const and non-const objects. The const after the method signature says the function will not modify any of the object's member variables. If you declare a member function const, and then it modifies a member variable, you'll get a compiler error.||0

l9liyxpjwl149v|Practice Midterm Question 7 Override Keyword|For question 7, I was wondering why the override keyword isn't used in the derived classes to override the play function that is declared in the instrument class? Does it matter that the override keyword is left out in the implementation of these functions?. |125|0|active|The students' answer is true. Using the `override` keyword explicitly tells the compiler that you intend to override the function with the same name and parameters from a base class. This keyword makes your code's intentions more clear to other humans, but it also causes the compiler to **make sure that overriding takes place**---if a function marked with `override` does not end up overriding a function from a base class (which could happen if their parameters quietly mismatched or the base class's function gets deleted), the compiler calls for your attention about this through an error.||2

Thanks!|5|0|private|ifstream's open() function is overloaded to take either a C++ string, or a char * (notice how in C++98, open() only supported char * as input, and was later updated in C++11).

However, we defined y as a char[] of individual characters, and we never included a '\0' anywhere in there. If we had done something like z, the compiler would have added this for us, but since we did it ourselves we're out of luck unless we specify it ourselves.. .

In other words, creating an object of type Toy is the issue here, because the compiler is not given an implementation of play(); so at runtime, if play() is called on a Toy object, we won't know what code to run!.

l9kpwtcm6ca2zk|Live practice midterm question 8 multiple possible solutions?|For question 8 on the live practice midterm, are there multiple correct solutions we could use? Mine is different from the sample solution.. . Is there an issue with my implementation? Thanks.. . |99|0|active|The issue with this implementation is that it fails when ptr is pointed at &triangle. Since you set tune() to be a pure virtual function, tune() MUST be overrode. Triangle doesn’t have a tune() member function.. . At run time, the ptr is statically an Instrument. When you say ptr->tune(), it goes looking for the definition of tune within Class Instrument. Then, the machine sees this is a virtual function and checks the dynamic type of what ptr is pointed at and tries to find tune() within that type. Hence, ptr=&triangle would try to find tune() within Class Triangle, and fail.||1
l9kp9qle4u3pi|Exam question|Will you get points taken off if you do i++ instead of ++i on the exam?|64|1|active|To add to the student's answer, let's say i = 5. ++i will first increment i and then return the new value, so ++i evaluates to 6 in this case. On the other hand, i++ returns the current value of i and then increments it, so i++ evaluates to 5; however, i is now equal to 6.. . In some contexts (such as incrementing a counter variable in a for-loop), it doesn't matter which operator you use. But if you are checking the value returned by the operator, then it matters which one you choose. In the latter case, you could lose points not for style, but for correctness.||0

Horn::play(); //calls the declaration of play() in Horn.     cout << ""[Trumpet]\n"";.   }. };. . int main() {.   Trumpet t;.   t.play();.   /*will output:.       [Horn].       [Trumpet].   */. }.

l9keebtkvct4oj|what does const mean?|For function like:. const string & describe()  const {.    }. What do these two const mean respectively?. Does the second const mean that the output of the function can never change? What does the first const mean?|85|0|active|The first const:This const is modifying the string& return type. Normally, this const wouldn’t really do anything, since if you’re just returning a value, it can be manipulated, stored, changed, etc. in the future by the rest of the program.. However, in this case, it does matter. Because the return type is string&, with the & denoting that it’s a reference, the value that’s returned is a reference to the string being gotten from the class. (I assume this is in the context of a getter function for a class on the live practice midterm). So you're not allowed to change the actual object's string value after the fact of getting it.. . The second const:. A const member function in a class (with const after the function signature) means that this member function is not allowed to modify any data associated with the class. This is a best practice to include. In this case, it’s. . Another thing to note: const will by default refer to code to the left, otherwise it will refer to code to the right. For example, in const int* const, both the integer value being pointed to and the pointer itself is constant (can’t be reassigned to another memory address).. . A way to think about it is that you can mentally break it up into. [const string &] [describe() const]. . The first bracket part thing only applies to the the thing that gets returned. The second bracket set applies to just the function itself. In this case, the first one is returning a constant reference, the second const refers to a guarantee that the function itself won't modify the data of the class.||0
l9kdctiay9m3q|Problem 3.2 Live Practice Exam|Hello, I was wondering if my solution would also work for question 3.2 on the live practice exam. If not, could you explain why it wouldn’t work.. .

I think it's a mistake to dereference `ptr` in line 3 though. `ptr` holds the address of `arr` (the first element of `arr`, that is), and the swap_min_front function expects a pointer for the first parameter value, so you should just pass in `ptr`.||0

l9k824chcsi4yd|Spring/Summer 2019 Exam Question 0b|Can someone explain what happens in the banana function for the code below? I'm confused as to how *arr is passed into the banana function in 5. Does *arr in the second line of 5 dereference the first value of arr, leading that first value to be passed into the function? Also, why is there a compiler error for 6? Is it because arr decays into a pointer when it is passed into the c variable in the function?. . . |78|1|active|You are correct about both questions. `banana(*arr, arr)` is really `banana(2, )`.

l9k6fkz766w1vx|Working with Abstract Classes|Can someone explain what we are allowed to do with abstract classes? I understand that an instance of an abstract class cannot be created but pointers that are an upcast to an abstract class can be created. I am mostly confused about what happens when these pointers are dereferenced or when functions are called on these pointers.. . For example, in the questions from the Spring 2019 exam shown below, why is there an error in the first piece of code but not an error in the second piece of code? I thought that both code would have errors because they dereferenced an abstract class pointer.. . . . |72|0|active|I believe this is due to 'object slicing'. When you do Toy * tptr = &rbot, you 'slice' the object such that tpr only points to the toy aspect of rbot. Thus, when you try to call introduce(a function of rbot), you get an error because tptr doesn't have an 'introduce' function. You cannot call introduce, because to tpr, it doesn't exist. the robot part of 'rbot' has the introduce function, and you 'sliced' it. get_year_made() works because get_year_made() is a function in the toy class. Therefore,to tptr, it exists and  you can call it with tptr->get_year_made()||2

l9k4ijbxinu7c|Difference Between Streams|Can someone explain the difference between the different types of streams to me? I understand fstreams so more so stringstreams and istreams and the difference between the two.|82|1|active|"So `istream` is the general type for input streams, or streams that read in information from some source. And `ostream` is the same thing but for outputting information *to* a source.. . The different types of streams specify what this ""source."" is. In the most common example, `iostream` is the stream for both input and output, and `cin` and `cout` specify that the source is the terminal.. . `fstream` means the source is a file. Declaring a variable of type `fstream` means the file has both read **and** write access, which might've resulted in a ""file not found"" error if you tried that on the autograder since the test files only have read access. And of course, `ifstream` and `ofstream` refer to input from and output to files respectively.. . As you've implied, `stringstreams` are the harder one to understand, because the source is a string. This might seem counterintuitive since the string is often stored on the stack anyways, so we're just reading data from one object into others, or writing data into that string. There are a couple reasons we use `stringstream` though. One is if we want to read a string and ignore whitespace just like `cin` does, so we can analyze a string word by word without manually checking for when each word starts and ends. As an example:. . ```. string s = ""This is a string."";. istringstream ss(s); // We initialize the string stream to take the string s as the input source.. string junk;. while (ss >> junk) {.   cout << junk << endl;. }. ```. The output will be. ```. This. is. a. string.. ```. . I've personally only really seen the `ostringstream` type used for testing, as we saw in project 2 when we had to test printing matrices and images without printing to standard output or a file.. ```. ostringstream ss;. ss << ""output"";. cout << ss.str() << endl;. ```. This will output. ```. output. ```"||0

l9j697x6dv615z|Live Practice Exam QS|1) for 5.1 is shoe a pointer in Shoe_init's parameter because Shoe_init takes in the address of an object? Basically if we see an & in front of one of the parameters does it mean that it takes in an address of an object and when we write the function for it we need to use *infront of that object to declare it as a pointer?. . 2) for questions like 6.2 will we be given the invariants for the actual exam?. . 3) For qs 7.1- 7.7 will we be asked to give an explanation on the actual exam or will it just ask us to choose compile error or no compile error?. . 4) are there 2 separate while loops for 4.1 in the answer?. . 5) Why is there a type mismatch for 2.6 but not 2.5? Doesn't 2.5 pass in an int(2) when the first parameter is a pointer for banana? is arr an int in this question?. . 6) why is 2.3 undefined but not 2.4?|109|0|active|1 - Yes. &  means pass by reference. If you don't pass by reference then a copy of the shoe object will be created then edited (so Shoe s would not be edited or changed in the function).. . 2 - It is not guaranteed that we will give you the invariants on the exam in every scenario. This is one of the concepts our class aims to teach so it is fair game for the exam.. . 3 - Some past exams have asked you to explain why you chose compile vs no compile as it is part of what we teach in this class. However, based on each exam we create and how the points fall it is not a guarantee that we will ask for an explanation for the midterm.. . 4 - Yes there are two separate while loops in the solution. The first one finds the very last element in the string. The second one moves the null char to the position of the first '  ' or '\t' at the end of the string. This cuts them off the end of the c-style string.. . 5-  The arguments are switched in 2.6. Because of array decay, passing arr in as a param passes in a pointer to the first element of the array. Banana requires the second param is a pointer, not the first. The second param in 2.6 uses * do dereference the pointer to the first element in the array, resulting in an integer. Banana requires the first param to be an integer, not the second. 2.5 passes in these parameters in the correct order.. . 6 - Apple is undefined because it returns the address of a local variable. The first param (a) is passed by value so a copy of the object is created when the apple function is called. When the apple function finishes execution, the local variables are all destroyed (this means a is destroyed). Unfortunately, we return a by reference not by value so no copy of the a object is returned. 'z' then holds a reference that points to nothing. Banana does not have this problem because it passes both its params by reference. There is only one integer throughout the entire program that == 2 and only one integer that == 3. When banana returns the pointer to c (or in this case x) it hasn't been deleted because it does not go out of scope in the banana function.. . Hope this helps!||0

l9izggi2kmd2ed|question from midterm practice|can someone explain why this doesn't compile? Thanks|88|0|active|The reason there’s an error is because this code is performing implicit downcasting.

l9h4gwmdobz6c5|Dynamic binding on &#34;.&#34;operator|"On the lecture notes, it says that ""pointers in C++ have a static"" and ""dynamic"" type. So it will be fine to use ptr->function to let the computer decide the correct version of the function. However, I'm wondering if polymorphism also works on non-pointers. . . For example, I see that in lab 6, the restaurant polymorphism uses the reference instead of a ptr. ""&card"" and ""card.purchase"" instead of ""*card"" and ""card->purchase"". . "|79|0|active|"Nice catch; I just tried this, and it looks like you can dynamically call virtual member functions using references. Here's a quick example to illustrate this behavior:. . #include <iostream>. . class Base {. public:.     virtual void hello() {.         std::cout << ""hello"" << std::endl;.     }. };. . class Derived : public Base {. public:.     virtual void hello() {.         std::cout << ""what's up"" << std::endl;.     }. };. . int main() {.     Derived d;.     Base &b = d;.     b.hello();. }. Try running the above snippet to verify Derived::hello() is called dynamically. Then, remove the ""virtual"" keywords from both hello() functions. Which hello() function do you think will be called now?. . However, note that we frequently use dynamic allocation and polymorphism together (that is, we create a pointer to an object that was allocated with the ""new"" keyword). You could track that object using just a reference, but this is probably bad style; the idiomatic way of tracking dynamic objects is to use a pointer, and then call ""delete"" on that pointer when the object's lifetime is finished. You can do this with references too, but it will raise some eyebrows, and we don't recommend it in 280."||1

I am fairly confident that D is a correct solution, as it uses the -> operator to dereference and get the age at people[0], which is a pointer.

A and B are not correct solutions because in both, we attempt to access `age` from the pointer directly instead of dereferencing the pointer and then accessing age.. . To elaborate, in A `*people` gives a pointer to `alex`. We then use the dot operator instead of the arrow operator, which will unsuccessfully attempt to get an `age` member variable from the pointer itself. In B, we do `(people->age)`, which is equivalent to `(*people.age)` and is therefore also wrong.||0
l9ezsxcfr434p8|FA 2019 Midterm Problem 4 Inheritance and Polymorphism|Hello, . . I had some questions about the solutions for problem 4 on the fall 2019 midterm. For the depletePower function, why isn't an override keyword included in the first line of the function? I thought that the override keyword should be included since the depletePower function for the Phone class overrides the depletePower function for the Device class.. . I was also confused about how to use the scope resolution operator. If the depletePower function is written outside of the class but has a fully qualified name (it is written as Phone::depletePower), then does that mean that the entire function is under the scope of the Phone class? Also, when getting a private member variable from a derived class, do we need to include the base class and the derived class for the scope of the variable (ex. Phone::Device::variable) or just the class that the variable is a member of (ex. Phone::variable)?. . For problem 2 of question 4d, why does the code have a compiler error? I though that it might be because the Device is an abstract class and a Device pointer is being dereferenced to call a function on it, but I wasn't sure.. .

Q: What should I do if I open the exam and I don't see the ""popup"" with the honor code info where I click ""I understand""?. A: This most likely means one of the 3rd part libraries used by the site didn't load correctly from its CDN. This can happen due to an unreliable internet connection or restrictions by your ISP or internet provider. Try refreshing the page a few times to see if it loads correctly. As long as it loads correctly once, you're all set (the exam application doesn't need to contact a server at all once it's started). If you have issues, please join our zoom call and we can help!. .

l91kapqsp6r2v3|When will we get studying material and information regarding the midterm?|Hello, I was just wondering when we will get more info about the midterm, type of questions to expect, and hopefully some practice questions. I think it would be beneficial to start studying early rather than waiting until project 3 is over.. Thanks.|86|1|active|Practice exams should have been released!

Is there any recommended resources?. . Best|95|0|active|I definitely recommend the practice tests that were recently released (can be found on the eecs280 website in files section on left hand side of toolbar ).

l8by0ks4l2s1dn|midterm and exam content|Hello, I wanted to know this a bit ahead of time. What will the midterm and final look like? Will it be primarily be on the lecture content with multiple choice questions regarding outputs of sample code or will we have to write some code ourselves too? |289|0|active|The midterm and final will both be online exams that can be taken remotely on your laptop. It's a combination of multiple choice, short answer, implementing functions, matching/fill in the blank... quite a variety, but that makes it a little more digestible to sit through, in my opinion!. . The exam will also be split into very clear sections based on the topics covered in lecture. A practice test will be released a bit before the exam, which should give you a really good picture of what the actual exam will be like.||1

We will, however, have some CAEN computers reserved on North Campus if students are looking for a quiet space. (I think the form to sign up for one of those will come out a little later!)||1
