l9q2ho5n5j62ft|c&#43;&#43; strings also null terminated?|Hi,. . I was wondering whether c++ strings are also null terminated?|68|0|active|Unfortunately, yes. This is required for `string::c_str()` ([documentation](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/c_str)) and `string::data()` to work. Outside of those functions, though, you shouldn’t rely on the null terminator.||0

l9lophdq4lt5j3|Output incorrect on autograder|Having an issue with our output for test50 while hearts is ordered up on line 39. Anyone know what could be wrong?. . |74|0|active|Assuming there aren't output mistakes with the other euchre public tests with SimplePlayers rather than HumanPlayers, then it seems like there's a bug in your code for HumanPlayer::play_card(). Since it's just straight up a number being passed in for which card to play and it's playing the wrong card, it's probably some simple indexing mistake.. . If you don't find it quickly try using the visual debugger tool to step through your HumanPlayer::play_card() code line by line to see where it starts behaving unexpectedly.||1
l9lktopme8n33g|Clarification on simple player|If my hand is:. ten of spades, jack of diamonds, queen of spades, ace of hearts and ace of clubs.. Led card is ten of hearts and trump is hearts.. Would simple player play the jack of diamonds?|45|0|active|Since SimplePlayers only consider the led card’s suit, they will play their highest hearts.In this case, all cards in their hand are non-hearts, except for the jack of diamonds. This is because hearts is trump, so the same-color Jack is the left bower. . So, yes the SimplePlayer will play the jack of diamonds.||0

l9kb9awwc665q3|error with human player|im getting this error for the human player tests. The previous two tests work so is this most likely a problem with my human class?This is currently what print out:. any ideas what may be going wrong? |68|0|active|It seems like you're indexing out of range somewhere in your program. Unfortunately that doesn't narrow it down all that much since there are so many places we use iterables like vector or array. It seems like you can narrow it down to the first time the human player has to `make_trump()`. . . As with a lot of bugs that are hard to trace, it's best to use the visual debugger to set a breakpoint and trace through your `HumanPlayer` `make_trump()` function to see exactly where in the function it's throwing an error. I'd recommend starting by stepping through your `make_trump()` function.. . Hope this helps!||0

Euchre.cpp compiles, and passes tests 00 and 50, however around half the time test 01 will fail, and the other half it will work perfectly and pass all 3 tests.

The led suit is spades and trump is hearts, though the issue isn't in card selection. Instead of the 9 of Clubs, Herb has in his hand and plays the 9 of DIAMONDS instead of clubs.. . We've checked all our files and suspect some sort of undefined behavior or memory error is causing it, but it happens only in this one trick and only half of the time.

l9ixn8xlo4574e|Bower confusion when playing card|If the only card in your hand that is of the led suit is a left bower, do we play that card or do we play the lowest card In our hand? For example in autograder the trump card is hearts, the led card is diamonds and Gabriel plays the nine of clubs even though he has the jack of diamonds in his hand.|48|0|active|If you can follow suit, you must. So if the led suit is Diamonds, you must play a diamond card if you have one. Once trump is declared, the left bower is considered the trump suit regardless of the original suit. So following the example, if the trump card is hearts, the Jack of Diamonds is the left bower and is thus considered a heart card. If the led card is then diamonds, they cannot follow suit by playing the Jack of Diamonds as it's a heart card.. . If trump is hearts, and the led card is diamonds, and the only two cards Gabriel has are the Nine of Clubs and the Jack of Diamonds, they will play the Nine of Clubs because they don't have any diamond cards, can't follow suit, and will thus play the lowest card in their hand.||0

Does that mean you would you still ask the dealer if they want to ""pass"" even though screw the dealer has invoked (in which case the rules dictate that they cannot pass and must order up)?

More specifically, I have some functions that sort the hand or check it and they are defined outside of the player class so when these helpers are called inside my Player classes, I pass the Player hand object in as a variable to the function. Is this OK to do or should I try and define these functions inside the player classes? The functions are never called outside the Player functions since they're simply helper functions for the Player functions. Since we're allowed to use algorithm::sort which modifies the hand inside of the Player function I assumed this counts as the same as that but I just wanted to double check.|94|1|active|If the functions are never called outside the Player class, then you really shouldn't need to define them anywhere besides Player.. If you implement these functions in Player then that would mean you wouldn't have to pass in hand as a parameter you could just access hand directly because you are already in Player.. Additionally, public functions that are not already in the header files can't be accessed outside the class. For example, if you make a public get_hand() function in player.cpp, you can't use that function in any other class, because get_hand() isn't in the header file that the autograder uses (not sure if this applies to your code but look out for it never the less).. ||0

l9h6drkz41y7d8|Making Trump(simple player)|In round one, if any player orders up, the upcard goes to the dealer’s hand and the dealer must discard one of their lowest card in their hand including the upcard, correct? It confuses me because in the spec, it says “the dealer is given the option to replace one of their cards with the upcard. But it’s actually a must, right? |90|0|active|If the upcard has a lower value than all of the other cards in the dealer's hand (make sure to consider that the upcard's suit is the trump suit now that it has been ordered up), then the dealer does not have to pick it up.. . For example, if the upcard was the Nine of Spades, but the dealer currently has the Ten of Spades, King of Spades, Ace of Spades , Jack of Clubs (left bower), and Jack of Spades, all of those cards are going to be higher value than the Nine of Spades, so the dealer will choose not to add the upcard to their hand.

However, I'm confused on how we would go from player 3 being the dealer to player 0 being the dealer. I was thinking we could use modular arithmetic somehow, but how would we go about it concretely?|66|0|active|Think about how the modulus operator works. Let's use the example of 3. If we keep increasing a number and get its value modulo 3, we see the following:. ```. 0 % 3 = 0. 1 % 3 = 1. 2 % 3 = 2. 3 % 3 = 0. 4 % 3 = 1. 5 % 3 = 2. 6 % 3 = 0. .... ```. . Notice how the output of the modulus operator is always less than 3 (logically, this make sense because a remainder shouldn't be greater than a quotient when you're dividing two numbers). Additionally, each time you increase the number, the output of the expression will increase - except when it goes back to 0. Think of how you can use these behaviors - constant increment and value always below the modulus number - to cycle through the indices of an array/vector.||1

Instead of the last 4 lines, try replacing it with hand.erase(hand.begin() + min_index). The manual swapping might be causing a seg fault in a specific instance. If that doesn't work try running it through caen so you can see exactly where the issue arises. ||1

From the spec: ""If a Simple Player can follow suit, they play the highest card that follows suit. Otherwise, they play the lowest card in their hand."". . is the actual suit the only thing that qualifies as the suit of lead? Not sure I understand this question, but yes, only the suit of the led card matters in deciding what to play. The rank of the led card doesn't matter for play_card.. . what if both the trump and lead suit are the same? The same thing goes, if they can follow suit, they will play the highest card that follows suit. Otherwise, they play the lowest card in their hand. Trump is included in this function so you can compare cards and find the highest/lowest, but the Simple Player is focusing on the suit of the led card, not the trump suit.. . I am confused about the left bower then does it count as the suit of the lead card or no? The left bower is decided by the trump suit. It is the Jack for the suit that's the same color as the trump suit. (If the trump suit is hearts, then the left bower is the Jack of Diamonds) However, the left bower is considered to be part of the trump suit, regardless of the original suit. So if the trump suit is hearts, the Jack of Diamonds is considered a heart card.. If trump = hearts, the Jack of Diamonds (left bower) is considered to be hearts.. If trump = diamonds, the Jack of Hearts (left bower) is considered to be hearts.. . I'm just confused about the situation and (if it exist) if another suit is considered the led suit even if it's not actually the same suit? Not sure I understand what you're asking here. The led suit is decided by the first card played in each trick.. . does this situation exist or are the explicit led suit cards the only cards that follow suit? I don't understand this question, but here's my guess. So, for tricks, the first card played decides the led suit. Say the first card played is the Nine of Diamonds. Diamonds is now the led suit. Now the next 3 players play, and now they must all follow suit if they are able to, meaning they must play Diamonds if they have any Diamonds. Only one player leads per trick (round), and then the other three just play a card (play_card).. . Hopefully this helps, feel free to ask more questions as I might've missed something."||1

Do we print both rounds? |137|0|active|If you want to make sure your print is correct, you can use sdiff - B (look at the blue box) here: https://eecs280staff.github.io/p3-euchre/#example-with-simple-players. But with ./euchre.exe pack.in noshuffle 1 Adi Simple Barbara Simple Chi-Chih Simple Dabbala Simple, the first instance does go to Round 2, so you can also look at that.. . For deciding trump:. You want to print passes until someone orders up. The dealer can't prevent someone from ordering up; players just decide if they want to or not.. . So it goes:. Round 1:. Player 1 decides if they want to order up. If they pass, Player 2 decides,. If they pass, Player 3 decides,. If they pass, Player 0 (dealer) decides. . If dealer passes, we go to Round 2:. Player 0 considers again. If they pass, Player 1 considers. If they pass, Player 2 considers. If they pass, Player 3 considers. If they pass, Screw the Dealer happens and the dealer is forced to order up. . In terms of how to print in euchre.cpp, you should print passes until someone orders up. So from the first Simple player test:. Hand 0. Adi deals. Jack of Diamonds turned up. Barbara passes. Chi-Chih passes. Dabbala passes. Adi passes. Barbara orders up Hearts. . Player 1 passed, Player 2 passed, Player 3 passed, and then Player 0 (Adi the dealer) passes, so it goes to Round 2. But you don't state Round 1 or 2, just print passes until someone orders up, and then print them ordering up.||0

l9fhhpwqfml34d|Getting Bad Error. Is my erase_card_from_hand function okay?|. . . Hello! I'm using an erase card helper function to account for when a player plays a card, it would be removed from their hand immediately. It is given a card to remove, then erases it from the hand vector. Any suggestions on how I should fix this function?|10|0|private|From your for loop, it looks like you're starting at i = 0 and going to i = n while erasing the element at i. This will end up with it not doing what you probably want it to do.. . Say you start with a vector of size 3:. at i = 0, you erase the first element. Now your vector's size is 2.. at i = 1, you erase the second element of your new vector (not the first). Now your size is 1.. at i = 2, the vector's size is 1, so it doesn't enter the for loop and misses something. If per chance you were able to enter the vector, then you'd try to erase the third element of a vector with only one element left.. . EDIT: I suggest you look into vector pop_back() or clear() functions.||1

l9f3rzkkgk71zf|Instant Segmentation Fault with Human Player Example|Hello, not sure what can be done without looking at actual code, but I coded euchre.cpp and my test lined up with the Simple Players, and nearly lined up with Human players. I made a few changes (from passing by reference to passing by address) and suddenly, doing the Human test for euchre.cpp results in an instant segmentation error. I un-did the changes, but I either missed something or something happened, as now doing the Human test results in the segmentation error.. . I commented out game.play(), as well as the entire main file, and added cout statements right after main is called, but it always has an instant Segmentation error.. . On top of that, the code works fine with the Simple player test. I can do it and it works as expected, whereas the Human test still causes the segmentation error.. . So this works:. ./euchre.exe pack.in noshuffle 1 Adi Simple Barbara Simple Chi-Chih Simple Dabbala Simple > euchre_test00.out. . But this causes an instant segmentation error:. ./euchre.exe pack.in noshuffle 3 Ivan Human Judea Human Kunle Human Liskov Human < euchre_test50.in > euchre_test50.out. .

If you remove it, it will no longer override the `make_trump` function in `Player` and won't be used. A better strategy is to make sure the cards are always sorted, which you would have to do by putting the `sort` function in every function.. . It doesn't have to be the `sort` function specifically, a better practice is to have a function that enforces all invariants (cleans up the data) and call that at the end of every function. For this project, since we only have this sorting invariant it's either/or.. . The cards in the `Simple` player don't always have to be sorted, but it may help. The cards in `Human` don't *technically* always have to be sorted, but they do each time `print` is called, so you might as well keep them always sorted.. .

We believe we are dealing correctly so all the player should have 5 cards in hand and so we don't know why the player would have zero cards after only 2 tricks. . .

l9eb3g84baw4lw|trump function in euchre|should our trump function in euchre have the same parameters as make trump in player or should it have none?|97|0|active|Not sure if this is helpful, but I believe it's your call as you're making the function. Your trump function could have zero parameters, or multiple, it all depends on what you want your function to do.. . For example, do you need to know the round to call your function? Assuming your trump function is deciding trump, you could either use the round or not. You could have the function take in Round 1, and then if trump still hasn't been decided, input Round 2 and try again. Or you could have your trump function activate only once, regardless of round, and then mess with the round within the function itself.. . I would write the function with no parameters (for now) and then when/if you need something as you're writing it, you can add it to the parameters. Then you end up with the parameters you need.. . To specifically address the question, if you copied all the same parameters as make_trump() in player.cpp, you would have upcard, is_dealer, round, and the order_up_suit string. Is_dealer is a boolean for a specific player, and so using that parameter wouldn't make sense unless your function only affects one specific player. However, deciding trump is entirely based around the upcard, so that parameter does make sense. But it all comes down to how you what you want to do.||0
l9eaxwaqmhm3co|should we be incrementing round?|i never incremented round but are we supposed to? im confused how it comes into play in trump if we never set it. How do we get that information / set the round?|64|1|active|Assuming you're talking about deciding trump, deciding trump is either 1 or 2 rounds. It starts on Round 1, and then after Round 1 ends, if trump still hasn't been decided, Round 2 starts.. . After the cards are dealt, and the upcard is flipped, you know the Round is 1. Then how you manage things is up to you. You could have a function take in the Round #, and then for Round 2, increment the round from 1 to 2 and call the function again. Or your function could just have Round 2 activate if Round 1 failed to find trump. You don't necessarily need to increment (Idk if autograder would prefer it a certain way, I didn't increment but haven't submitted to autograder yet), but you can if it works for you.||0
l9eau6jc49x2c3|main function|im confused about the main function specifically when I call make trump to run the game in main. how do i get is dealer and the round and trump and all the parameters?|90|0|active|The main function shouldn't call make_trump(), it should just create the game and then activate the play function for that specific game.. . As for creating the game, when you call make_trump for a specific player, you need to know the Card upcard, bool is_dealer, and int round. Because you decide trump after cards have been dealt, you can flip a card from the deck to get the upcard. The dealer has already dealt, so when using this on a player, you know if they're the dealer or not. As for the round, you know it's Round 1 for the first phase of deciding trump, and then if it doesn't get decided in that round, it switches to Round 2.. . I'm not sure if I understood you correctly though, you may be asking about something else.||0

l9e5u9eikz4144|euchre_test01.out.correct Hand 10 Make trump|When making trump in hand 10 of euchre_test01.out.correct, why does Edsger order up Spades instead of Herb ordering up Clubs?. . For context, this is round 2 where Gabriel is the dealer and the upcard is Ace of Clubs:. Herb's Hand:. 1) Ace of Diamonds. 2) Queen of Clubs. 3) Jack of Diamonds. 4) Ten of Hearts. 5) Nine of Clubs. . Edsger's Hand:. 1) Ten of Diamonds. 2) Nine of Hearts. 3) Ace of Hearts. 4) Queen of Spades. 5) Jack of Clubs. . Since Herb is before Edsger in the ordering up process, its round 2 and Herb has a Queen of Clubs which is a face card and matches the upcard's suit: Clubs. I would think that Herb orders up with Clubs because of his Queen of Clubs matching the Ace of Clubs suite, however, the correct implementation skips Herb and says that Edsger orders up Spades with his Queen of Spades. Why does Herb pass and Edger order up when Herb has Queen of Clubs that matches the upcard?|90|0|active|The reason this occurs is because in round 2 of making trump, players are not allowed to order up the same suit as the upcard was in round 1. Because of this rule, the spec makes SimplePlayers only consider the same-color suit as the upcard. So in this case, for round 2 each player is considering whether they have at least 1 face-or-ace of spades since the upcard was clubs.||0

If you are looking through the code you've written, and it feels like you've done the same thing in multiple places or there are large chunks of code that correspond to one special process, consider abstracting whatever that is away into a function of its own.

l9bvyo0do8u55y|comparing color of cards in make_trump|In writing my code for round 2 of making trump for the simple player, I'm currently having trouble trying to figure out how to find out if the simple player has the same color card as the up card color. The way I'm currently doing it is by iterating through the player's card array. Then I have 4 separate nested if statements for all the possible suits of the up card. Then, I check to see if the card suit is the same color, but different suit of the up card. For example, if the suit of the up card is hearts, then the nested if checks if the suit of the card in the player's hand is diamonds. If this is true, then the nested if loop returns true and makes the order up suit diamonds. While I believe this works and makes sense logically, it is resulting in a very very long function. So I am wondering if anyone has advice for a more efficient way to see if the card in the player's card array is the same color as the up card?|81|0|active|Try making use of your get_suit() function thats implemented in card.cpp. It can be implemented with 4 if statements fairly concisely.

Yup, as specified in the spec, Simple player strategy only considers the led card suit. If the player cannot follow suit then you must determine the lowest card in the hand.

l99c4evykn23fm|make trump human version|so for the human player version of make trump inside the player.cpp file, do I need to ask for input from the user inside the function itself? Isn't it the work of game driver? The way spec says it sounds like I will write code to ask for user input within the make trump function!. . Also, I am not required to overload the make_trump function right? Because if I am taking inputs from user, then I will have to overload the function and change the parameters maybe?|113|0|active|You should not overload make_trump(). Keep its parameters as is. This is because of polymorphism (and the autograder). We want to be able to call functions with the same parameters on both Simple and Human Players when they are both statically typed as just Players. This means the Human Player functions will have to handle certain input and output inside of their implementations.||2

l998wkbg4lj5c0|Do I have to use pointers in player.cpp?|Do I need to use pointers in my player.cpp ? For some of the functions, I created a new vector of cards that for example stores the card that follows the led suit in the play_card function. But when I am now trying to remove the desired card from player's hand, I am unable to do it because I used a separate vector. Now do I need to replace my codes by using pointers? or is there another way to do it?. . Edit: after thinking about it for a while, I think I can do it with a vector of the Index that will store the location of cards inside the player's hand vector. But I want to make sure if I must use pointers instead.|115|0|active|If you are modifying the player hand from within the class that owns the player hand member variable you can modify it directly (member variables are akin to global scope within the class itself). Think about how you can resolve your separate vectors with the actual member that represents the real hand. If you are still having trouble come to OH or make a private post so I can get more context about your approach.||2
l9982esx65l6mu|failing code duplication in Card.cpp|I am getting flagged for having code duplication in card.cpp . I am confused why I am getting it, does anyone have any tips? ( I think that its in operator<, based on what autograder says ). . (also) why is it important to not duplicate code?|95|0|active|Code duplication means that you are writing the same lines of code (or similar) in multiple places. You don't want to do this because it makes it harder to change your program if the way you need to implement it changes. Instead of changing your code in just one place, you have to find every place where your code is used again and change that. Through this, you are very likely to leave one place different and may introduce bugs.. . As for tips, think about how the operators could use each other. For example, on the number line, the `=` operators are mutually exclusive (none of the numbers that will hold true for `=` and vice versa). Think of how you can use relationships like these to build your operators off each other.||1

This isn't as much of a priority in EECS 280, but writing readable code is a great skill to practice.

If that's not the case, and this isn't the best solution, but perhaps you can pass in the filename (string) to your Game ADT and open it inside the class.

However, having too many can make it more complicated than necessary.. For example, you don't need to do the command line parsing and error checking in the game structure itself. (In other words, you don't need one for each of 12 command line arguments). You can parse in main and just pass in what you need for the game constructor.||1

Edit: I also think that the left bower becomes the right bower now during second round and the right bower becomes the left bower. Am I right?|70|0|active|Trump changes every round, not every trick.

Then, figure out an ordering of the cards that'll force those scenarios to happen, and make a sample `pack.in` file that has that ordering. For simplicity, test it without shuffling and for only one hand so you can focus on that one specific case you're testing. . .

l9787k6hjfz6y0|Passing parameters by reference and calling functions|Hi, . . I noticed in some of the functions that were included for us throughout the project, the parameters were passed by reference and some of the function headers included the reference operator as well. In general, when should we pass parameters by reference and what does it mean to include a reference operator in the function header?. . For example (in Player.h):. SimplePlayer (const string &name). const string & get_name()|107|1|active|. when should we pass parameters by reference. . If you want to be able to modify the original object passed in, you should use pass by reference. If you don't, a copy of the object will be passed in, so any modifications you make to it won't apply to the original object.. If you don't need the original object, it is still sometimes good practice to pass a const reference to an object into a function. Small primitive values like integers can be copied quickly, but larger objects (such as strings, vectors, types you create, etc.) might take excessive time and memory to copy. Passing by reference solves this performance issue; you'll learn more about this in EECS 281!. . . what does it mean to include a reference operator in the function header. . This means the function returns a reference to something; for example, Player::get_name() returns a const reference to the name string in the Player object you called the function on. We could just return a normal string instead in this case, but this also avoids an unnecessary copy. However, if we call get_name() and save its output to a string reference variable, and then delete the Player object, the string reference is no longer valid. This is one of the drawbacks of returning references to member variables: It can complicate lifetimes. However, this probably won't be a problem in P3.||1

l92zofbmofk6ef|Attempt to erase from container error|Hello! My roommate and I have this undefined behavior showing up and we are unsure what it means. Any input would be appreciated. |129|1|active|It’s likely that you are passing an out of bounds index to the erase() function. Remember that the hand is not always of size 5, and make sure your index that you pass in is smaller than the size of the vector.. . Tip: It's much easier to create an iterator for the card you're wanting to delete like such. auto card = (something). and then you can just call. hand.erase(card);. Then you don't have to worry about bounds, assuming you get the iterator correct.||1

How do I access the name to return? I have the same question for add_card(), how do I access the Player's hand? Am I missing something here? Thanks. |164|0|active|If you are trying to return a value that is stored in the class, you can just call the value by name. For example. ```cpp. class A {. public:.   int f() {.     return a;.   }.   private:.     int a;. }. ```. What happens behind the scenes is that the compiler will pass a `this` pointer to every function as a parameter and if it can't find a variable that you reference, it will try to dereference `this` and find the variable inside of the class member.. . In the example above, in the function `f()`, we reference a variable named `a` which we didn't define in this scope. However, we do have a private member variable `a` which is part of the class the function is a part of. The compiler tries to resolve `a` by replacing it with `this->a`, which does work because `a` is a member variable of the class. This is how you'd return a member variable - you can read more [here](https://eecs280staff.github.io/notes/08_ADTs_in_C%2B%2B.html#implicit-this) if you're still confused.||0

You'd likely have to make another array of smaller size and copy everything but your excluded element into there.. . To instead move an element to the back, you'd just have to swap two elements of the array(the target element and the last element). To implement this, you'd get a variable to store the value of the target, then make the value at the target location in the array the same as the end of the array, and finally make the value at the end of the array the variable you stored before (or do something similar).. .

Note that the sort function modifies the hand. You cannot modify member variables in a const function, so you’ll receive a compiler error if you call sort in a const member function.. You shouldn’t need to sort using card less. When you print the hand in order it should be sorted using the < operator. You could sort with card less when determining what action to take, but you should be able to find the min/max card in the hand without sorting. You could use a functor to sort using card less, but those are only covered later in the course. Generally: if you need to use sort, just the default one will be fine.. . .

Also in the add_and_discard function, are we supposed to call sort after we add the upcard to the hand and then call print(), since it says it should always print the cards sorted? Because wouldn't that impact the indexing for -1 if the Human wanted to discard the upcard immediately?. |230|0|active|Simply using the code provided for sort should use the comparison code you've written, so you'll be just fine there. You should be sorting the hand any time it changes, or the first time it's set up. Before any print, it should be sorted, and since this modifies the original vector itself, you can use the new indices that the user inputs. The -1 should probably be a special check, as calling hand[-1] will crash.. When prompting the user, you should be displaying the 5 cards in their hand, and the -1 is giving them the option to ignore the upcard.

You can program it to read from `cin`.. . > **tl;dr** just put `< file_name` at the end of your command to read from a file for human player input. . A little lesson on the terminal and input streams:. . There are three main input/output streams to every program:. - `STDIN`, which is console input (what you type into the terminal when the program prompts you to). - `STDOUT`, which is console output (what the program prints out to the terminal after you run it. - `STDERR`, which is another console output stream for error messages (but we won't use this). . When you refer to `cin` or `cout` in a C++ program, you are referring to `STDIN` and `STDOUT` respectively. As defined above, these are normally just given from terminal input and output. However, when we are executing programs, we can **redirect** these inputs and outputs to come from somewhere else.. - If we use `< file_name` after a program name, the program will instead take the contents of `file_name` to be `STDIN`. . - Similarly, if we use `> file_name` after a program name, the program will print to the file (and overwrite everything in the file) instead of the terminal when we write it.. . In the tests of `euchre.exe` we will simply feed in human input through the command line using these redirects. For example, the command you would use to test `euchre_test50.out.correct` would be. ```bash. ./euchre.exe pack.in noshuffle 3 Ivan Human Judea Human Kunle Human Liskov Human  euchre_test50.out. ```.

l8z8o9nunyi29o|Why does address sanitizer work differently on CAEN computers vs my laptop?|Hey! Quick question:. . On every project now, I've had code that works beautifully on my laptop but inexplicably blows up on the CAEN computers, usually due to some address sanitizer issue. I know the address sanitizer on my laptop works because I've triggered it quite a few times, but how come it doesn't raise an issue sometimes despite CAEN machines finding one?. . I'm on an M1 MacBook - do I need to install some latest version of a package, or something? It makes it really annoying to try to debug when I can't use the visual debugger and have to go off line numbers and error tracing from terminal output.. . Also, and this is the very weird part, sometimes code that passes on the CAEN computers AND my laptop will fail on the autograder. I don't see how... is there some catch-all setting I can enable to get all these errors without having to check my code in 3 places?. . Thank you!|73|0|active|From the [address sanitizer tutorial](https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_asan.html):. > **WARNING:** The address sanitizer will not work on heavily resource limited system such as CAEN Linux.. . The system is configured to not use address sanitizer. Remember to remove those flags when you compile on CAEN. Additionally, the debugger is not compatible with the address sanitizer.. . As for the autograder/CAEN/home setup issue, I wouldn't know why something would fail on the autograder if it passes on CAEN - everything I've run on CAEN works the same as AG. I believe others have had similar issues so it would be best if an instructor could take a look at your submissions.. . Hope this helps!||2

Since print_hand() is a private function, I'm confused on how we can assert different expectations for what should be in the player's hand after a Player function is called.|187|0|active|I don't believe there's a way to directly check the player's hand after a function call since the corresponding functions and variables are all private. What you can do is after calling a function that edits hand, like add_and_discard(), you can then call functions such as lead_card() repeatedly to check if the rest of the cards are what you expect.. ||0

Thank you so much!|240|0|active|The public test case isn't wrong. Keep in mind that `shuffle` should shuffle the deck 7 times, and check that your `Pack` initial order is correct.||1
l8v1f9xwcfv2wb|Shuffle helper function|I probably overcomplicated this function, but this was the way that made sense to me logically, however I fear that it doesn't work... That said, I just don't understand why I can't create these arrays to feed into the function so that I can at least debug itScreenshot_2022-10-04_at_22.50.55.png? . . I hope this question is okay to ask... If not, so sorry!|8|0|private|So the first error is in the initialization of `topHalf` and `bottomHalf`. Its just a simple syntax error where you can't use the `cards.begin()` iterator to initialize the card. What you should instead is a more direct card by card initialization using a loop.. . The second error is a result of you passing in an `std:array` object into the recShuffle function. Recall that C arrays are different than C++ arrays. The function `recShuffle` takes in two pointers to ints as an argument, but you pass in an stl object. Therefore, the compiler will complain and tell you that you're passing in the wrong things. Another error with that line is that `recShuffle` doesn't return a result, yet you use it to reassign it to cards. You can only use the `=` operator for assigning one object to another, so make sure you are returning an object at the end of recShuffle so you can assign it to cards.||0
l8v104iozmy2r1|tests|Are we writing tests for operator functions? or just the card ones?|76|0|active|Yes, testing the operators would be a good idea. To test an operator, you would just need to use that operator on two card objects. For example, Card a < Card b.||0

Or may we assume that the number of cards is 24?|243|1|active|In `Pack.h`, you can see that there is a private pack size variable declared:. `static const int PACK_SIZE = 24;`. This variable is constant for any pack you create, so it will not change. You can assume this is the set pack size as you implement the pack functions (ie. shuffle).||2

If anyone could give me some guidance that'd be awesome!|197|0|active|Derived classes allow abstraction so that the code that uses the `Player` class doesn't have to be changed for two different types of players. If you were to do without derived classes, you'd still have to write all the functions twice for different kinds of players and behaviors - having them in classes allows there to be more logical structure.. .

I am not entirely sure of the exact issue without more context, but I would double check that for whatever assert is failing, you have initialized all variables being used. Sometimes this kind of issue pops up when you forget to initialize a variable - for some runs that variable is initialized with a value that aligns with the assert passing, for other runs it might just get some garbage value. The easiest way to debug this would be with your visual debugger - you could see whatever variable has a garbage value when the assert is hit.||0

So, if the trump suit is Spades, then all cards that have the Spades suit is a trump card, including the Right Bower, i.e. the most powerful card in that round, the Jack of Spades.

Like should we reorder indicies with their own loops before reordering pack instead of just using the order of indicies we know would occur after seven shuffles from writing it out on paper?. . If there is an even more eloquent way than this, is there another resource we could reference other than the wikipedia page? I found the explanation there a bit confusing. Or any hints/first steps?. . |229|0|active|Yes, you could theoretically hard code this, but as per usual in hardcoding, it goes against the functionality of the function. What if you want to shuffle 52 cards instead of 26? What if that's a private test case?. . In this class we don't really need to care too much about efficiency, so the naive solution of writing an inshuffle to move around the indices once and then looping it 7 times should be sufficient.

Remember that derived classes also inherit the parent classes member functions, not only their variables!  For this project, you need to create two derived classes: Simple and Human. Human takes in human input from the terminal to determine what the player does. Simple is like the computer bot that has preprogrammed decisions to make during the game. For each of these, they are going to have the same functions (add card, make trump, etc) which is why they are derived from the Player class. You must code each of these functions for both Simple and Human to ensure that the entire game can be played no matter who is playing (4 bots, 4 humans, 2 and 2, etc).. . Hope this helps!||1

For example, dealing with bowers in `Card_less` kinda sucks, but there are only a couple of situations with bowers so you can make some hard-coded outputs at the beginning of the function and the rest of the data is clean and uniform.. . ```cpp. bool Card_less(const Card& a, const Card& b, /*other args*/) {. 	if (a.is_left_bower() && b.is_right_bower()) {. 		return /*some value*/. 	}. . 	// now none of the statements down here have to deal with. 	// a being the left bower when b is the right bower. }. ```. . This strategy/structure is called [guard statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(computer_science)) and can be helpful to clean some of your data or handle weird cases like this. Then, the rest of your code can just assume the normal patterns of cards and comparisons don't have to worry about weird things happening.||2

l8qcl0f12n81j8|Do we invoke screw the dealer if the dealer is a human player?|"Under ""simple player,"" the spec states that we invoke screw the dealer if we reach the dealer in the second round without anyone offering up a suit. Does this apply if the dealer is a human player as well?

l8qa337s3hhfl|Pack Question|I'm confused what the deal one function is supposed to do. Should it just return the first value? How does it know the index of the pack if the function has no inputs?. . |242|0|active|Note that the Pack.h file defines three private member variables: . . private:.   static const int PACK_SIZE = 24;.   std::array<Card, PACK_SIZE> cards;.   int next; //index of next card to be dealt. Use these member variables in your deal_one() function (and other functions with Pack.cpp). deal_one() will not need any inputs.||0

l8pekf2a15p7hf|operator overload question|When we implement operator overload, can we use the functions to get the rank and suit of the two cards and compare them directly (like lhs.get_rank() < rhs.get_rank()), or we need to compare them based on their position and size in the array?|184|0|active|"The issue with the first method is that rank and suit are both strings, so doing a ""<"" comparison wouldn't give you the desired result (e.g. even though 2 < 3, the string ""two"" is greater than the string ""three""). So the key is to use their positions in the arrays.. . As a hint though, you can call other operator overloads within each other (assuming you don't have a recursive loop, like having == call != and vice versa)"||2

l8p7wi7c6ca1v6|Card.cpp modifier|Card.cpp file does not contain any modifiers. I wonder if I am allowed to construct a modifier for instances of Card, allowing me to use brute force test methods for Card.cpp functions|154|0|active|"No. Check the requirements and restrictions section. In the second entry of the table, it says that while you may ""Write helper functions in Card.cpp and Pack.cpp as non-member functions in the .cpp files and declare them static,"" you may not ""modify .h files."" If you want a modifier on Card to be useful at all, you will need to modify Card.h, but this is strictly forbidden. (And violating this rule will not get you anywhere). That said, you should not need to modify Card objects via an explicit modifier to test all of the functions completely."||1
l8p50x80q4dlg|For the pack constructor, does it need to pull cards from the deck in any suit order?||187|0|active|For the default constructor, the suit order must be Spades -> Hearts -> Clubs -> Diamonds.

l8oyyme3se53lo|Operator Test Cases|In the specs for how to overload the operators for the card class, it says that all we have to write originally are the less than case and the equal to case and we can derive the rest from those 2 operators.

l8ousiit4f3cd|Card_Less function|For this function, are we allowed to assume that the 2 cards passed into this function won't be the same card, its not in the RME's for this function but for the program that we're making, it wouldn't make sense if we passed the exact same card twice to this function?|197|0|active|No, you cannot assume that. Note that you cannot assume this for the less-than operator (<) that we implemented—that is, the less than operator can take in two cards of the same value. If you remember this, the fact that the cards can be the same should not be prohibitive.||0

When I disable clangd it doesn't give me this error but it also doesn't catch errors in my code at all if I disable it. |122|0|active|Sounds like clangd might be using an older C++ standard - as constexpr was added to the language in C++11, which is the version this class uses.

l8op102s4wkvt|How many bugs are there to expose?|In @1107, someone asked the same question for project 2. Now, for project 3, how many possible bugs can we expose in Card_tests and Player_tests (so we can build more comprehensive test suites)?|113|0|active|Good question, I don't know the exact number, but, I know that when you submit test cases to the autograder, it tells you how many bugs you caught and how many points you got, so that should probably help know how many test cases to write. Specifically for this project, you should have at least a few test cases for every function.||0
l8o4f8mhj8a1za|&#34;Does not consider trump&#34;|I'm confused about how to ignore the trump suit when there is no member variable that tells us which suit is the trump.. For instance, how do we determine which suit to return in Card::get_suit(const std::string &trump) when we don't have a pre-set value for trump?|217|3|active|"I think what your asking about is Card::get_suit(), not Card::get_suit(const std::string &trump). In the example of Card::get_suit(), we don't want to consider trump, meaning that whatever the suit the card is, that is what we want to return. . . Now say we have Card::get_suit(const std::string &trump), where &trump is passed in and we do want to consider trump, then there is 1 case where we don't want to return the ""exact"" suit of the card.. . This 1 case is when we are looking at the left bower. . . Let's say the trump suit is Hearts, in this case, the left-bower would be Jack-of-Diamonds.. . Technically, what is the suit of Jack-of-Diamonds? (The suit is Diamonds). . buttttt since this is the left bower, we want to consider the suit to be hearts, so that's what Card::get_suit(const std::string &trump) would return.. . Again, in the case when we call the function Card::get_suit() on the left bower (Jack-of-Diamonds), then we'll just return Diamonds since we're not considering trump for this function."||1

l8n5az5r5ev2rg|P3 FAQ|Refer to this post for Frequently Asked Questions on Project 3. Project 3 CHECKPOINT will be due on Monday, October 10 at 8pm EST. Project 3 (full project) will be due on Friday, October 21 at 8pm EST. The spec can be found here.. From the FAQ:. Q: I’ve never played Euchre before, how do I learn the rules of the game?. . A: Pages 2-5 of the spec detail the rules of “EECS 280 Euchre”. Also, a staff member from prior semesters made a video tutorial a few years ago that may be helpful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jGJ0NRcrc. . 0:33 Dealing. . 1:55 The Upcard / Making Trump Round 1. . 5:35 Making Trump Round 2. . 7:20 Leading the First Trick. . 8:20 The Other Players Play Cards in the First Trick. . 10:58 Deciding who Wins the First Trick. . 11:24 Leading the Second Trick. . 12:00 Playing the Rest of the Hand. . 20:30 Scoring. . 21:23 Determining Whether Another Hand should be Played - Ending. . There will also be a euchre social on October 1st from 12 - 2 pm where you can get one-on-one help from IAs to learn euchre.. . Q: What do I have to submit to pass the checkpoint?. . The checkpoint includes all the files except the driver (Card.cpp, Card_tests.cpp, Pack.cpp, Player.cpp, Player_tests.cpp). It will make up 0.5% of your overall course grade.. . Q: Can I add helper functions while implementing the Player classes?. . You are allowed to use helper functions, but these helper functions should not change the interface of the class. So within your implementations of the class’s member functions, feel free to call helpers. But in your test files, you should not assume that these functions exist (because you should not alter the interface for the classes). This also applies in your euchre driver as well! e.g. If you add a helper function to the simple player class, you can use it within that class, but you can’t use it in the driver since it won’t be part of the Player interface!. . This is especially important because when we run your test cases against an intentionally buggy solution, that solution will not have your specially defined helper functions! So just use the interfaces of each class when you test them.. . Q: Why am I getting a compiler error for calling sort?. . Note that the sort function modifies the hand. You cannot modify member variables in a const function, so you’ll receive a compiler error you call sort in a const member function.. . You shouldn’t need to sort using card less. When you print the hand in order it should be sorted using the < operator. You could sort with card less when determining what action to take, but you should be able to find the min/max card in the hand without sorting. You could use a functor to sort using card less, but those are only covered later in the course. Generally: if you need to use sort, just the default one will be fine.. . Similarly: Q: I’m getting a compiler error related to swap?. . This is the same question as the one above.  Use @1781 to direct students. . Q: Why am I passing euchre public test, but failing euchre public test with solution card, pack, and player?. . This means that when your euchre.cpp is run with the instructor solution implementations of card, pack, and player you produce incorrect output. This likely means that you’re making an incorrect assumption about what functionality should go in card/pack/player versus in the game of euchre. For example, make sure that you’re not printing output in player.cpp that should be printed in euchre.cpp.. . Q: Why won’t pack.in open in pack public tests when running on Xcode?. . Click on the name of your scheme in the toolbar at the top left, Edit Scheme > Options > Enable “Custom Working Directory” and press the little folder icon. Pick the folder that contains your code along with pack.in. This will ensure that the file is visible to your executable. This is usually not a problem, and we are investigating the issue.. . Q: How do I debug and add in command line arguments with XCode/VSCode/VS?. . Follow this link  and click on your specific IDE, then click on the “Arguments and options” subsection.. . Q: Should I be printing the incoming arguments from the command line?. . Yes, according to the spec: “First, print the executable and all arguments on the first line. Print a single space at the end, which makes it easier to print an array.”. . Q: Do I need to worry about the human player doing (insert illegal move) during the game?. . No, in accordance with the spec you can assume that a human player will follow the rules of the game and will not attempt to cheat.. |870|5|active|||0

l8jjanmh2oz6rb|P3 Matrix.cpp Code compiles but fails basic and print tests|What exactly does the segmentation fault error mean for the print function and how can I fix the Basic test to pass.. . |182|1|active|Segfaults are caused by a program trying to read or write an illegal memory location. In practice, segfaults are almost always due to trying to read or write a non-existent array element, not properly defining a pointer before using it, or (in C programs) accidentally using a variable's value as an address..
