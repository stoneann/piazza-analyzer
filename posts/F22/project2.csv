lb3zazh8vi66x5|bts test|May I know how to create a binary tree in the test? Does it just use insert to create a binary tree.|137|0|active|BinarySearchTree has constructors. In order to create a binary search tree, you need a typename T and a comparator (optional, the default one is std::less<T>). Just like how you want to create a vector of int (you use vector<int>), you can create a binary search tree in a similar way.. After you create one, you can insert nodes to the tree. You can also use the copy constructor to create another tree.||0
l8t6dxclbin2rr|were we supposed to include assert statements in our functions?|Did we just need them in our tests or in our functions as well? I have heard conflicting things and want to make sure. Thanks!|85|0|active|In your non-test functions (so your functions in Matrix.cpp, Image.cpp, etc), you didn't need to assert anything. However, it is good practice to assert the invariants specified in the function's REQUIRES clause. While the autograder won't test your functions with inputs that break these invariants, it's possible for you to make implementation mistakes that break these invariants -- assert statements help you find these bugs!||0

The only error output I'm getting is the failed ASSERT that the correct image and the carved image I produced are not the same.. . (Assertion `Image_equal(carved_img, carved_img_correct)' failed.). . I can't figure out anything wrong - Autograder isn't helpful because all it says is the failed ASSERT as well -- visually debugging does nothing because it's just a slew of numbers that mean nothing to me and I can't manually find which ones are wrong. . . I'm just at a bit of a loss as to how to even approach debugging this. Does anyone have any sort of idea what could be wrong/ how to try and debug this?. .

Thanks, sorry for the late frantic post.|111|0|active|(assuming your matrix and image functions work) You should look very closely on how you are handling the seam carving of your image. Very carefully. Take another look at the spec example of how carving works and double check all processing functions to prove to yourself that the functions are handling each edge case exactly as it is supposed to. Draw it out, may seem tedious but for some bugs this is the only way to find them.||0

l8m5hgi1adg20w|Horses.ppm cost keeps timing out on autograder.|I would really like some help with identifying where my code is taking the longest. My code passes crabster.ppm very quickly, but horses.ppm times out on compute_vertical_cost_matrix. I'm having trouble determining where I'm being inefficient; every function I look at already seems to be doing its job the simplest way. . . I suspect it might be my Matrix_min_value_in_row, which has two (non-nested) for loops, but only one of them will run in a given call. since the function is exclusive of column_end, i have an if-statement that runs a different loop if the column_end is exactly one less than the width of the matrix to allow me to compute cost for the second-to-last column of a cost matrix.. . If any instructor is able to check the code I submitted to the autograder, that would be super appreciated.. |74|0|active|Try using the perf utility, which should help you find exactly what function is causing the slowdown. Another possible reason you cannot run through horses.ppm is a memory leak.

l8lwjwlcz7t7mm|Image_get_pixel taking too long to run|. My Image_get_pixel is drastically slowing down my code. All of our processing public tests are passing, however very slowly (crabster takes two minutes, and each removed seam in horses takes a minute). Is anyone else experiencing this issue? I don't know how we can further simplify our Image_get_pixel function. Getting rid of the asserts isn't helping, either. I'm afraid that our public tests will time out in autograder.. |82|0|active|It might not even be that Image_get_pixel() is taking that long. It could be that you're calling it too often by iterating over pixels that you don't have to iterate over, or you're iterating over a bunch of pixels multiple times.. .

Horse typically takes longer than other tests but it shouldn’t be that long.. . Sometimes you might be calling helper functions meant to ""respect the interface"" within the actually interface they are meant to protect, which is not the use for then. This can really take up a ton of time if the function is called a bunch - think about how much longer it takes for your computer to access a value of class through a function then just by directly calling it (it can be around 2-3x slower!) That being said, do NOT go and replace these functions by just calling the values in places you aren't supposed to (eg other interfaces) to just save time. It's poor practice and the autograder will complain."||1

Super weird that all the other functions work on crabster, but it fails at seam_carve().

I'm not sure why that is but please let me know what I should check for or look for!!. . Thanks!!|71|0|active|The one big thing I see is that you're using the min() function with 3 arguments, which doesn't actually work since it only works with 2 arguments to take the minimum of. If you include a third argument, it actually has to be a comparator (more on what that is later this semester).. . To fix this, see if you can use the Matrix_column_of_min_value_in_row() function.||1
l8luf3vkjut51n|crabster find seam|Hi! I am failing the crabster find_seam test. I went through the code 1000 times now, but I can´t find any bugs etc. Does anyone have an advice what I should be looking out for? Common mistakes, edge cases etc.. Thank you so much!|80|0|active|If you’ve already followed your code through the debugger and it does what you expect (which ends up being wrong), then perhaps your understanding of the seam function’s intended behavior is wrong.. . I misunderstood this function at first as well. As detailed in the spec here, the bounds for finding the minimum cost actually change depending on which column the minimum was in for the previously parsed row. Although the diagram in the spec does not deviate much from the initial minimum being in the 3rd column, it would be possible to have a minimum seam cross in a diagonal direction across an image.. . Here is another diagram illustrating this: . The circles are the minimum value found in the inclusive bounds, and the boxes are the corresponding new bounds for the next row's analysis.. . Another common mistake is not using bounds that span from n-1 to n+2 to account for the fact that the matrix minimum column function has an inclusive lower bound and and exclusive upper bound. .

l8lsgh2aiw66gl|Print test basic fails|Each time I run the test the numbers that should be pixel color values change. I think this has to do with my second image init function but can not figure out where the problem is. Am I correct in assuming this is the problem because it prints the correctly? |91|0|active|Your intuition on where the issue is possible. It seems like the numbers being outputted are not even close to the integers (0 or 255) that we expect them to be, however they are not pointers (these will print starting with 0x). This seems like the image's r, g, and b channel matrices are never properly being set.. . Make sure that when you transfer `is` stream values to the matrices, you are dereferencing the `Matrix_at()` value. `Matrix_at()` returns a pointer to the integer you want to change, so just performing `is >> Matrix_at(r_channel, x, y)` will not change the actual value associated with the matrix cell at row x and column y.. . I also recommend placing a breakpoint in your image_init() and image_print() functions so you can follow the program flow line by line and monitor where variable values are not what you expect.. . Hope this helps.||1
l8lsg2ogfr4401|Conceptual confusion Vert Cost Matrix|. Right now I am having issues with computing the vertical cost matrix. When. . .

I want to include that right (green, 2940) column so I end my bound at the next one over (blue square) because of exclusivity. However, because of that correction that means Matrix_at goes OOB (assertion flag) because I add one additional to column_end. I don't really understand why min_value_in_row is exclusive at the end nor how I would fix it. . |59|1|active|Your understanding the vertical cost  function is correct, in that you need to have bounds i-1 and i+2. However, when you are on the left edge of the matrix, you’re bound i-1 will OOB and on the right side i+w2 will too. Try using logic to determine if you are at a first or last column and adjusting the bounds accordingly. You will need to do this every time you compute a cost.. . I hope this helps!||0

l8lbf7qx3qh257|Changing MAX_MATRIX_WIDTH/HEIGHT for tests|Say I want to write test cases that will check my funcions are working when matrix_height/width are equal to the MAX_MATRIX_WIDTH/HEIGHT. I was thinking making the maxes smaller in matrix.h in order to make it run faster, or should I just keep it 500x500 since the autograder will use those values? |74|0|active|You should keep it 500 and 500 - I don't see how changing these would make the program run faster. When the program creates the initial data array in `Matrix`, it shouldn't run slower depending on the size of the array, since it isn't initializing anything in that array yet. It's just sectioning off an area of memory that's marked for your to use later. Unless your system is really strapped for memory, initializing a 250000 size array shouldn't take much more time than a 250 size array.. . If you do have an efficiency problem, I would suggest looking into your getter and setter functions (`Matrix_at`, down the line `Image_get_pixel`, `Image_set_pixel`). These functions are used often and need to be fast for every other function to be fast.||0

It functions in a similar environment to the autograder and may find bugs in how your code compiles on different setups. The main cause for this problem (at least in project 1) was that VSCode or local compilers on your computer may detect libraries automatically and CAEN/autograder would not.

It looks like you allocate dynamic memory for energy/cost matrices once at the beginning of the function, but then attempt to deallocate them in every iteration of your while loop.

Otherwise, you are trying to reuse these matricies in the next iteration of the while loop, even though they have been deallocated.||1

l8kzzckk2rc3p5|Couple questions about resize.cpp|For resize, I think I have the first few steps correct, but then I'm a little lost on the rest. I use ifstream and open the file using argv[1], create a new image, and then call Image_init to initialize the height and width. After that I then close the file. Is this the point at which I close the file or do I wait until the very end?. . My thought was to create if and else-if statements to initialize the image based on if there are 4 or 5 arguments. And then I called seam_carve, but then the program just seems to stop after that (when I go through it with my debugger), so it never makes it to Image_print. Is there something that I am doing wrong or missing?|105|0|active|You can close the input file after initializing the image. I don't think whether there are 4 or 5 arguments should change how you initialize the image. What it does change though, is what parameters you call seam_carve with. In the case where there is a height argument, you pass that argument to seam_carve. In the case where there is not a height argument (argc = 4), you pass the Image_height of the input image to seam_carve. I am not sure why your program seems to stop. I would take a careful look at your if-then logic.||1
l8kzyzan8bw6yu|compute_vertical_cost_matrix|I have completed these steps. Initialize the cost Matrix with the same size as the energy Matrix.Fill in costs for the first row (index 0). The cost for these pixels is just the energy.. However, I am confused about filling the rest of the cost matrix. I know that we need the min energy of the three pixels straight above, left, and right. But how do get the energy of those pixels ? Do I have to call square difference or do I have to copy the entire energy matrix onto the cost matrix and then use the energy of those pixels (now in cost) to compute the cost?. . Also, how do I think about staying in bounds?. . thank u! . |90|0|active|you can use a pointer to the same row and column in the energy matrix. . and do some loop and pointer trick with it to set the values of the cost matrix equal to the values of the energy matrix. . u need to use the below formula as the spec states. . . . and to stay in bounds, just use some if else statement around your loop and modify the formula in the spec according to your needs||1

For your second error, `img-›red_channel.data = red` isn't working for a couple of reasons.. . One, `img->red_channel` gives a pointer to the red_channel matrix. You want to dereference this pointer in order to actually modify anything in that object. Also, I'm assuming `red` is an integer. `red_channel` is of course an integer array, and you cannot assign that a value of an integer.. . Second, although there are other issues with this line as explained above, you do not want to be accessing the .data array from the channels directly.

How do I account for the directory that the files resize is reading from and writing to? Should I just assume that they are in the same directory as the program? |99|0|active|I think you can assume the arguments will always be passed in the order given by the example (I think they would include that in the error checking section if it was necessary).. The file you are writing to does not have to be created before running resize.. Assuming you are using fstream, the directory that you are reading and writing from depends on the input. If the input is a file path, you will read and write to the directory/file specified by the file path. If the input is just a filename, you will read and write to the same directory as the program. You don't have to account for the directory inside of your program.||0

For some reason it is only giving a wrong value when the matrix_public_test.exe file is executed. Can someone say why this is happening?|96|0|active|The root cause is in your `Matrix_at` implementation. It appears to treat `row` and `column` as starting from 1 even though they actually start from 0. When `row == 0`, and `column == 0`, we're referring to the valid top left cell of a matrix.. . (How do we find this root cause? Your `Matrix_print` printed `42 1`, which suggests that the matrix's width got set to 42 even though it got initialized to 1. Where could this have come from? Most likely line 49 of Matrix_public_test, where we have the most relevant appearance of 42. How did that end up setting the width instead? You might have stepped before of the `data` array and ended up overwriting the width instead. **You can verify all of this by setting a breakpoint on that line 49 and stepping into `Matrix_at` in the debugger.**)||1

Thanks.. ptrerror1.png. incompints.png. Here's my Image.cpp file.. Image.cpp|6|0|private|For your pointer for loop, remember that you can use pointer arithemetic to help you here. Your pointer should start by pointing to an address in memory that you want to start looking at, not the value 0. For example, if you wanted to start your loop at index (2, 3), you would have a pointer pointing to that element. . If you wanted your loop to end at index (2, 5), you'd want to go until your pointer is less than the address of that index. More information here: https://eecs280staff.github.io/notes/04_Arrays.html#array-indexing I'd check out the traversal by pointer section!. For your image errors, it looks like you're setting image->red_channel.data(which is an array of ints) to a single integer, which is where the error comes from.

l8jp9b5yf81b6|Matrix_row problem|For Matrix_row, our thought process behind this was to find the distance between the pointer given and mat->data. Then, to find the row, we did the distance / mat->width. We are passing the public tests for Matrix_row, but not our own personal tests, and we can't seem to pinpoint the issue using the debugger. Any thoughts on what could be the issue?|91|0|active|According to your autograder submission from the time, you mixed up the row and height numbers between `Matrix_init` and `Matrix_at` in your test. By calling `Matrix_init(mat, 3, 4)`, you initialized `mat` to have a _width of 3_ and a _height of 4_. This means it has 3 _columns_ and 4 _rows_, so the valid columns are 0, 1, 2, while the valid rows are 0, 1, 2, 3.. . Then, you did `Matrix_at(mat, 0, 3)`, which takes row 0 and column 3. `mat` does not have a column 3 (only 0, 1, and 2), so the 3 was out-of-bounds.. . Long story short, the ordering of the parameters in `Matrix_init` and `Matrix_at` are effectively swapped. For some `Matrix_init(mat, x, y)`, `Matrix_at(mat, a, b)` must satisfy `a ||1

Thank you so much for your help and time! |97|0|active|"`heap-buffer-overflow` typically means your program is trying to access heap memory beyond the end of a chunk of heap memory that it owns. Take a closer look at the address sanitizer's error (from the submission timestamped at 9:26 PM)---the first lines include a stack trace taken at the instant the illegal memory access occurred. Line 4 ends in ""Matrix.cpp:23"", so it tells you that line 23 in Matrix.cpp caused the illegal memory access. How could that line have led your program to access memory past the end of a chunk it owns?. . By comparing the program's output during the UB check and that during the double-free/corruption test run, you can tell that both errors happened inside the same test case, so they are probably related. By fixing the UB problem, you will probably fix the double-free/corruption error as well."||1

l8jj0qsxlmu331|Get_pixel: unsure how to return a pixel? Set_pixel: confused as to the difference in code?|Hihi, . . I've been digging through multiple Piazza posts on the topic and wanted to reach out for specific help. As I'm working on the Image.cpp file, I have encountered an obvious issue where my code for the image_get_pixel and image_set_pixel function are relatively the same. The only difference I understand is having to return a pixel (which I'm struggling to figure out) and returning nothing with the void function. I know the question may seem vague, but I would appreciate some clarification and potential guidance on this. I have attached my code for the two functions below. Thank you!. . . // REQUIRES: img points to a valid Image. //           0 <= row && row < Image_height(img). //           0 <= column && column < Image_width(img). // EFFECTS:  Returns the pixel in the Image at the given row and column..

Might be easier to read this way.. |6|0|private|"You have the right idea in the Image_get_pixel function as it is supposed to just access the Matrix channels of the image and return the values in a Pixel struct. You just have to return the Pixel object you create and not the general ""Pixel"" data type.. . For Image_set_pixel, you do not return anything as the goal is to again index into the Matrix channels of the image, and this time set the three matrices at the given row and column with the given pixel. You do not need to call Image_get_pixel in there as you are given the Pixel you are setting the color channels to via the ""Pixel color"" parameter. Using this parameter, access the color channel matrices at the given row/col and set each one to the corresponding value of the color parameter."||0

In this implementation, a new auxiliary image is created and the new rotated image is stored into it. Then we need to copy data into original.. . When copying data back into original, why it is implemented in such way? To my understanding, the memory diagram  should be like, there are two image objects in the dynamic allocated memory. Before copying back, img is pointed to the original image object and aux is pointed to the new rotated image. Therefore, we need to first delete the original image object in the dynamic memory, then let img points to the new rotated image.

Also, if the const keyword is before Matrix instead of *, shouldn't it be holding the matrix behind the pointer const, not the pointer itself?. . Thank you!.

l8gg3w31fkg73o|Compute_vertical_cost_matrix()|Hello,. . I was debugging my code, and when I went to my compute_vertical_cost_matrix function, I realized that I was violating the requires clause of the matrix_min_value_in_row() when I was doing the edge case for when calculating the matrix pixel on the last column. . . What I currently have is Matrix_min_value_in_row(cost, row - 1, col, col + 2), but when I do col + 2, it goes out of bounds. The only reason I am doing col + 2 is because the RME for matrix_min_value_in_row says that the function is exclusive on the column end part. . . Any help would be appreciated :)|137|3|active|I think I found the problem here. Even when the function is exclusive on the last column, you don't need to do col + 2, just do col + 1 instead. This way, if your for loop has (index < col_end), it will never actually try to index out of bounds. Right now, with your code, it indexes at data[col + 1], which is not possible.

l8g5swg7yua1sx|resize.cpp Memory leak|Hello,. I have been testing my resize.cpp function to see what it would do if I gave it an invalid input. My file did crash and return the proper error message when I used an invalid input, but it also detected a memory leak because I needed to declare a new *img before I could check its width/height. Since my program exited before deleting the *img, it causes a memory leak. Is there a way to change my code to avoid this memory leak or is it important? I could put delete img in the if statement checking for the invalid input, but I check for multiple errors throughout my code so I was wondering if there was a better way to avoid a memory leak.. |6|0|private|You should reorganize the code to avoid any memory leaks. This can come in the form of deleting your img on every return, or only creating the img after you check error conditions. How you go about it is up to you, but there should be no memory leaks present in your code.||0

I am quite unfamiler with c++ syntax, please help!!!. . |104|0|active|row, mat->width, and column are all numbers, so any calculation with them will give you a number, which we can think of as an index. When declaring pointers, we need to set them to the address of objects, not the object's value. . . With that being said, if you've figured out how to calculate the index of an element, then you've already accomplished most of this function. An index is essentially how many elements away you are from the beginning of an array. We also know that arrays are represented as pointers to their first element. We can translate the index of an element into the address of an element using pointer arithmetic. ||0

From red, green, and blue you can form almost all colors so these are used (in combination with each other) to form colors on a screen. In the project your input is given by the values of these three channels (which is why your image struct stores all of them), you then do consistent operations on these channels in order to do seam carving and the other stuff listed in the spec.

THANK YOU. |116|0|active|To calculate the energy for each non-border pixel X, we use the formula `energy(X) = squared\_difference(N, S) + squared\_difference(W, E)`. . The values for N, S, E, and W are simply the adjacent pixels. This is why we only use this method to calculate the energy for non-border pixels. So north is simply `row_of_x - 1`, east is `column_of_x + 1`, etc. In a double for loop, you can use those offsets from the current pixel being calculated.. .

From my understanding of it, it is selecting a pixel in the image from a specified row and column and setting it to the color of the RGB values from the pixel struct obtained from the Image_get_pixel. The part I don't understand is how does it set it to that color and how does VS code read it as a color?|125|0|active|`Image_get_pixel()` shouldn’t change any values in the `Image`. That’s what `Image_set_pixel()` is for. If you look in `Image.h`, you’ll see that the return type of `Image_get_pixel()` is `Pixel`. Your code needs to create a `Pixel` (you don’t need to use new), set its values to the corresponding values in the red, green, and blue matrices, and then return that `Pixel`.. . To answer the second part of your question, reading color values is super simple because each one is just an `int`. VS Code doesn't need to do anything special.||0

My function works when implemented this way.

This would run faster due to fewer loops.. . Is the efficiency here that important? Which method would you recommend?|6|0|private|We recommend the first way. `Matrix_init` is meant to be called exactly once to initialize a matrix, and doing the second method would break that desired interface.

The reason why ""new"" returns a pointer is because it allocates the new object on the heap, which is typically far away in memory from where the current function's activation record on the stack is. Thus, we need a pointer to that location  on the heap so we can access and modify the object. Don't worry if this doesn't make too much sense yet -- we'll spend a lot of time talking about dynamic allocation later on in lecture!.

From the RME of the function, ""mat points to a valid Matrix"", ""Returns a pointer to the element in the Matrix at the given row and column"". So max is given (data type: Matrix *), but what you want to return is a pointer that points to an element in the Matrix (data type: int *).. 2. I recommend checking lab 3 again. Remember the elements of an array are stored contiguously in memory. In other words, they are next to each other. So if a pointer points to the first element, what is the thing that the pointer (pointer+1) points to? You may do the math and find the pointer that points to the wanted element.. 3.

You'll have to initialize max to some value, typically either a really low value (negative, so like -2000000000), or to the first value of the array, and then subtract one from that value. You won't need to modify the matrix at all, and max can be overwritten (max is not a const)."||1
l8bruwtrste5kf|Image_init and Image_print|Hello,. . I have 2 questions about the image.cpp file. For my image_init file, I have been doing img->red_channel.data[i], but reading the spec again, I am not allowed to do that. I tried to do Matrix_at for this, but then I got stuck on trying to figure out the row and col parameters.. . My second question is about the for loop in image_print. I'm pretty sure we have to do a nested for loop with width and height, but I do not know how to progress past that. Any help would be appreciated.|247|0|active|So for your first question, as it is mainly a syntax question, I will just give you the syntax answer:. . Matrix_init(&img->red_channel, width, height);. Now, I think they actually gave us this line to use in the specs, but in the first Image_init, I want to remind you that you are just initializing the width and height of the image, and all of its matrices. You will use this syntax a lot in many functions, specifically &img->red_channel.. . For question 2, I would suggest writing Image_get_pixel first, and then using that for the output of three different parts of the pixel to the ostream (but the 2D for loop is right, good job!)||0

Additionally, the leak sanitizer won't work since my compiler claims it does not support `-fsanitize=leak`, so how should I go about looking for memory leak issues?|164|1|active|To clarify: any time you use the `new` keyword, you will need to use the `delete` keyword on the object you allocated once you are done using it, to ensure all memory allocated is deallocated, and nothing is leaked.||1

I have also seen students with memory issues on these larger files because they did use new/delete in their Matrix/Image implementations.

You're always given ""mat,"" which is a pointer to the object you'll be working with. For example, in Matrix_width, you want to return mat's width. Recall the definition for the Matrix struct (in Matrix.h):. . struct Matrix{.   int width;.   int height;.   int data[MAX_MATRIX_WIDTH * MAX_MATRIX_HEIGHT];. };.

Something else you may need to help understand which row or column it should be in is the example 5x3 array in the spec.

l84na07wrkk1j4|P2 Allowed to use &#34;using namespace std&#34;?|"Are we allowed to include ""using namespace std"" at the top of our Matrix.cpp file? Or should I just do std:: next to everything (for example, std::cout)?"|176|1|active|"To augment the student answer, it's considered bad practice to include ""using namespace <anything>"" in a .h file (since then if someone down the road includes your library, you are forcing them to use that namespace which could cause naming conflicts). Other than that, you should feel free to to include that statement in any .cpp file."||0
l84lh3i8ywu3ox|How to read in ppm file from istream in Project 2|I've been working on Project 2 and am stuck on the Image_init function that reads a PPM file from istream. I read the write-up, but I don't understand how to use >> to read-in the file. Are we supposed to use specific functions like getLine from the istream? I have ideas about how to process the file, but I'm just really confused on how to actually obtain it from istream. |17|0|private|If you imagine the `istream` to just be `cin`, it acts in the same way as though you were reading the file from user input. Does that answer your question?||1

l83ma99apif4o4|User-defined structs.|Since the spec does not permit std::pair<>, are we allowed to create user-defined structs to remove duplicate code?|25|0|private|You can, but you have to do so in the `.cpp` files rather than the `.h` files, meaning you could only access the structs in those given files. I'm confused as to where you'd want to use a custom struct, however.||0
l83jx5lw1pa4y2|Project partner if i&#39;m retaking the class?|I'm currently retaking EECS 280. I was wondering if I was allowed to collaborate with a project partner for the upcoming projects if i'm retaking the class? I genuinely work better in a collaborative environments (and i did not do great on some of the projects the first time I did them), but I don't want to do anything that breaks honor code and I understand if this is not allowed. Thank you!. |166|0|active|In the partner guideline, it mentions that you can choose to find a partner, but you should start the project from scratch instead of using your legacy codes.. https://eecs280.org/syllabus.html#project-partnerships||0

l836xlbl8091x6|version control|The version control setup tutorial features p1-stats instead of p2-cv. Does it matter if we setup version control with p1-stats even though we are using it for p2-cv, or should we set it up in our p2-cv directory instead? Only problem I see with the second option is that we don't have any starter code for p2-cv yet when it asks us to go through the version control setup tutorial. . . Thank you!|14|0|private|The p2 spec shows you where to fetch starter files from. From there, you can basically repeat the same steps as in the p1-stats tutorial but with your p2 files instead.||0
l82ox6dnlue41r|Project 2 FAQ|"Refer to this post for Frequently Asked Questions regarding Project 2. Project 2 is due Wednesday, September 28th at 8pm.  Please keep the followups related to questions in this post only.. . Spec is here. . Resize GUI repository (you can use this to easily try your resize code on other images!): https://github.com/oalejel/resize-GUI. Write clear code! This is especially important for this project, remember:Matrix width = # of columnsMatrix height = # of rowsInstead of using variables like ""i"" and ""j"" in your for-loops, consider using ""row"" and ""col"" so you don't get confused!Q: Am I required to use traversal by pointer?A: No. You are allowed to, but not required to use traversal by pointer in this project. You should choose to traverse by index/pointer based on what makes sense to you logically.Q: My program takes a couple minutes or more to run. Is this expected? A: Yes, but not too long - your program should run in under 30 seconds. Double check that you're not looping unnecessarily or calling an inefficient function within a loop. Perf is also a helpful tool for improving efficiency! https://eecs280staff.github.io/p2-cv/#appendix-b-perf-tutorialQ: Rotate left is failing, even though it was provided. Is there an error in the provided function? A: Rotate left calls several student implemented image functions, which can cause errors in rotate left.Q: Why do I have to write functions like Matrix_width? Couldn't I just use matrix->width directly?A: Unless you're implementing a Matrix function, this is generally considered really poor design! We actually consider this incorrect behavior, even if you get the right results, so please make sure you use the right function. Even if it's just Matrix_width and Matrix_height, whenever you're not writing Matrix functions, go through the interface - the same goes for Image as well.Q: Do I have to respect the interface when writing tests?A: Yes, tests should always respect the interface! In the real world, this means you can reuse tests when changing the implementation to make sure that you haven't also changed the interface, such that you can avoid updating the code everywhere the interface is used!Q: How can I test Matrix_at without breaking the interface?A: When thinking of unit testing, you should think in units as behavior instead of units as functions, because it is common to have functions like Matrix_at that solely rely on the underlying implementation. When testing Matrix_at, we really want to test the behavior of setting and retrieving independent values reliably from our matrix. For example, you could test that setting a value at (0,1) doesn't modify the value at (1,0) or other similar variations of this.Q: What does it mean for the column start to be inclusive and the column end to be exclusive? A: This means that when looking for the min value, you should consider the column start but not column end. For example, if my column start was 2 and my column end was 5, I would consider columns 2,3, and 4, but not 5. Q: Why am I failing crabster but passing dog and horses?A: Crabster tends to catch more edge cases. Be sure that in all cases you're checking the correct columns when you compute the energy, cost, and seam.. Q: One of my processing test is failing, but when I print out the output it matches the correct file. A: Double check your image init. If you read in the correct image incorrectly, then Image_equal will fail even if you've processed the image correctly.. . Q: I am missing some test cases. What other tests should I write to catch the test cases?. A: Sorry! We don't share what test cases the AG is looking for. The best advice we can give it to brainstorm more edge cases. . . Q: I'm trying to run processing_public_test.cpp/resize.cpp on XCode, and Xcode is saying that it's unable to open dog.ppm/crabster.ppm/horses.ppm.. A: You need to update XCode's custom working directory: https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_xcode.html#run. Happy coding!"|842|4|active|||0
